## High Risk
### TRST-H-1 First liquidity provider receives increased returned shorts due to increased duration
**Description:**
When updating duration weight, pool’s **lastTimestamp** is initially set to 0. During the first call
to `PoolLibrary.updateDurationWeightBeforeMaturity()`, the amount of returned shorts will be
calculated based on a duration starting at the start of the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). As a
result, the first liquidity provider’s position will accumulate 53+ years of short tokens, which
will let the liquidity provider claim more returned shorts than expected–the excess amount
will be subtracted from the returned shorts of other liquidity providers. In other words, first
liquidity provider will be able to claim other liquidity providers’ shorts.
The vulnerability can be exploited by any first liquidity provider in a pool. On the first deposit,
`PoolLibrary.mint()` will not update duration weight since pool’s liquidity will be 0; however,
pool’s **lastTimestamp** will be initialized at 0 (the default value of uint256). The position’s
**shortReturnedGrowth** will be set to 0 since the pool won’t accumulate any returned shorts
by this time. Any other deposit of liquidity will trigger a call to
`PoolLibrary.updateDurationWeightBeforeMaturity()`, which will accrue returned shorts for a
duration computed as **block.timestamp** - 0, resulting in an increased value of
**shortReturnedGrowth**. As a result, the first liquidity provider’s position will accumulate
increased shorts, while other liquidity providers’ positions will accumulate correct amounts.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
When adding initial liquidity to a pool, consider setting pool’s **lastTimestamp** to
**block.timestamp**. Additionally, ensure that pool’s **lastTimestamp** is handled correctly when
removing and re-adding the entire liquidity of a pool.

**Team response:**
This issue has been fixed as was suggested, in the commit linked here (https://github.com/Timeswap-Labs/Timeswap-V2-Monorepo/commit/cfbae00d6af384ea9b2f477ba7cecc1ff4f3009a)

**Mitigation review:**
Fixed as per the recommendation: **pool.lastTimestamp** is set to the current block timestamp
when liquidity is minted in a pool with 0 liquidity.


### TRST-H-2 Pool initialization can be front-ran to manipulate the interest rate
**Description:**
A pool can be permissionlessly initialized multiple times, each time setting a different interest
rate. An interest rate can be set by either a liquidity provider or a malicious actor. When a
liquidity provider creates a new pool, they send two transactions:
1. In the first transaction, they initialize the pool and set an interest rate.
2. In the second transaction, they add liquidity to the pool. Pools with a positive liquidity
cannot have their interest rate changed via initialization.
A malicious actor can sandwich the second transaction to:
1. Initialize the pool with a higher interest rate.
2. Force the liquidity provider to provide liquidity at the increased interest rate (i.e. at an
increased APR).
3. Lend long tokens to the pool at the increased rate to get more short tokens. The short
tokens can be converted to assets after maturity and claimed for underlying assets.
This kind of attacks is economically reasonable for attackers because it’s liquidity providers
who pay interest to lenders. However, liquidity providers won’t get compensated because no
borrowers will be interested in borrowing tokens at an increased interest rate. Thus, a
malicious lender can set a higher interest rate and force a liquidity provider to give the lender
more short tokens. In the opposite direction, borrowers may also manipulate the initial
interest rate to borrow option tokens from a LP at a low rate.
Moreover, this kind of attack is feasible because liquidity providers will always have enough
short tokens:the common scenario is when liquidity providers have leftovershorttokens after
providing liquidity. By manipulating the interest rate, those leftover tokens can be instead
deposited as liquidity and “bought” by lenders at a manipulated rate. In the worst-case
scenario, all leftover option tokens of a liquidity provider can be “bought” by lenders or
borrowers.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider reworking the initialization of a pool so that a liquidity provider can always provide
initial liquidity at a chosen interest rate. This may require adding the initial interest rate as a
key to the TimeswapV2Pool.pool mapping, so that each pool is identified by a strike price, a
maturity date, and an initial interest rate.

**Team Response:**
"This may be mitigated by making a multicall to both initialise and addLiquidity at the same
time. We currently utilise the same while creating a new pool."

**Mitigation review:**
In packages/v2-pool/README.md, a note was added:
"It is recommended to call initialize and mint for the initial liquidity addition
in a single multicall as otherwise it is possible for a malicious actor to
sandwich the transactions."
The issue remains valid when a multicall contract is not used. Some alternative fixes are
proposed:
1. Validation check in `TimeswapV2Pool.initialize()` that sqrtInterestRate() is only within
a valid range. The valid range may be 1% to 1000% APR or whichever the dev team
thinks is a reasonable upper-bound.
2. `TimeswapV2Pool.mint()` should also require a minimum amount of initial liquidity
minted to make front-running to set the `sqrtInterestRate()` prohibitively expensive.



## Medium Risk
### TRST-M-1 Short token amounts rounding can result in a revert when burning options
**Description:**
In `OptionLibrary.mint()`, when computing the amount of shorts in a GivenTokensAndLongs
transaction, the "round up" flag is set to **false**, but, during burning in `OptionLibrary.burn()`, it's
set to **true**. This can result in a reverted transaction when burning all previously minted tokens
using a GivenTokensAndLongs transaction: the rounding in `OptionLibrary.burn()` will increase
the amount of short tokens to burn by 1, which will result in an "Arithmetic over/underflow"
error. In such situations, to burn their tokens users will have to use the GivenShorts
transaction type, which requires extra calculations.


**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider using consistent rounding when computing the amount of short tokens from
amounts of long tokens via `StrikeConversion.combine()`. In the current implementation,
`OptionLibrary.burn()`, `OptionLibrary.totalPosition()`, and `OptionLibrary.collect()` round up, but
OptionLibrary.mint() rounds down.

**Team Response:**
"After deliberation we have arrived at the conclusion that this roundUp/roundDown issue
mentioned is to documented.
Unfortunately cannot roundUp during the mint.
As a workaround the same library StrikeConversion may be utilized in calculating the input for
the burn transaction, instead of taking the output from the mint transaction, this is currently
being followed in our peripheries.
This would resultin the userlosing about 1 unit position, thisis a limitation of the workaround."

**Mitigation review:**
In packages/v2-pool/README.md, a note was added:
The contracts like most others roundUp/roundDown calculations, which may
account for some minor loss from rounding. Eg: When minting using
givenTokensAndLong and burning using givenTokensAndLong using given,
the total short that one can burn might be 1 less than the actual short position
owned. This maybe mitigated by using the same library as the one pool uses
while calculating the long amount required for the short position amount.
The issue remains valid and cannot be fully fixed because burning of option tokens is
implemented as redeeming of short options with a conversion of short options to long
options. The amount of short options is rounded up when the GivenTokensAndLongs
transaction type is used, which forces users to provide +1 short options and burn -1 long
options. Thus, the GivenTokensAndLongs transaction type cannot be seemed as an exact
input one when burning all short/long tokens of an address.
A possible fix would be to remove the GivenTokensAndLongs branch in `OptionLibrary.mint()`.

### TRST-M-2 TimeswapV2PoolFactory allows creation of pools with non-standard option contracts
**Description:**
The `TimeswapV2PoolFactory.create()` function doesn’t check that the provided options
contract was created via the official TimeswapV2OptionFactory. This allows creation of official
pools (i.e. pools created via the official TimeswapV2PoolFactory) with non-official underlying
options contracts. Since option contracts accept and store user funds, this poses a severe risk
for users who interact with Timeswap pools.

A malicious actor can:
1) deploy a malicious TimeswapV2Option contract that sends all funds to the malicious actor
after maturity;
2) create a pool for the malicious options contract using the official Timeswap pool factory;
3) trick users into using the pool to provide liquidity and lend and borrow options.
Users will trust the pool because it’ll be created via the official factory.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider reworking the `TimeswapV2PoolFactory.create()` function to take a pair of token
addresses instead of an options contract address. Having token addresses, the function can
get an options contract address from the official TimeswapV2OptionFactory deployment.

**Team Response:**
Has been identified and fixed here: commit (https://github.com/Timeswap-Labs/Timeswap-V2-Monorepo/commit/e32cf3697691c20be327978b50947c0172cb2240)

**Mitigation review:**
TimeswapV2PoolFactory.create() was updated as per the recommendation.


### TRST-M-3 Wrong ERC1155 metadata URI
**Description:**
TimeswapV2LiquidityToken and TimeswapV2Token implement the ERC1155 metadata
extension, however they incorrectly set the URIs. As per the ERC1155 specification:
The URI MUST point to a JSON file that conformsto the "ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON
Schema”.
Incorrectly-set URIs will affect off-chain integrations with the tokens that will try to read
tokens’ metadata and fail.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider correctly setting the URIs in TimeswapV2LiquidityToken and TimeswapV2Token.
Alternatively, consider not implementing the metadata extension since it’s optional (this
would require copying the ERC1155 implementation from OpenZeppelin and removing the
metadata extension implementation; also, the IERC1155MetadataURI interface selector
should be removed from supported interfaces).

**Team Response:**
The issue was fixed as is suggested in this commit: commit.(https://github.com/Timeswap-Labs/Timeswap-V2-Monorepo/pull/483/commits/946eb502e3373b6339009121c1ca5f8d57be73ff)

**Mitigation review:**
TimeswapV2LiquidityToken and TimeswapV2Token were updated as per the
recommendation: the contracts set a metadata URI in their constructors.


## Low Risk
### TRST-L-1 Incorrect validation of strike price
**Description:**
When validating the properties of TimeswapV2PoolCollectProtocolFeesParam and
TimeswapV2PoolCollectTransactionFeesAndShortReturnedParam, `Error.zeroInput()` is thrown
if both requested token amounts and the strike price are zero. This would make a positive
requested token amount and a zero strike price pass the check, while zero strike price is
invalid.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider reworking the logic of the checks as follows:
1. If all requested token amounts are 0, revert.
2. Or, if the strike price is zero, revert.

**Team Response:**
The issue was fixed, as is suggested, commit (https://github.com/Timeswap-Labs/Timeswap-V2-Monorepo/pull/482/commits/6cb06436be4dfb0c3123dd3a7f86bad395351cae)

**Mitigation review:**
The code was updated as per the recommendation.


### TRST-L-2 Missing indexed fields in ITimeswapV2PoolFactory.Created
**Description:**
The ITimeswapV2PoolFactory.Create event doesn’t have indexed fields. Event fields marked
with the **indexed** keywords are indexed by Ethereum nodes to make searched and filtering
eventsfaster. If an event doesn’t have indexed fields, off-chain monitoring and analyzing tools
will have to scan the entire transaction history of a contract to find and filter events by field
values.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider adding indexed fields to the ITimeswapV2PoolFactory.Create event. The three fields
of the event look like valid candidates to be indexed since, for off-chain monitoring tools, it
can be important to filter events by pool creators, option pair addresses, and pool pair
addresses.

**Team Response:**
The issue was fixed as is suggested, commit (https://github.com/Timeswap-Labs/Timeswap-V2-Monorepo/pull/482/commits/853391edc40c61892d6576f8f9bf9b215668939b)

**Mitigation review**
The code was updated as per the recommendation.



### TRST-L-3 Protocol fees management
**Description:**
Timeswap pools subtract protocol fees from transaction fees. The size of protocol fees is set
by the protocol owners upon deployment of pools. Potentially, protocol fees can be as big as
100% of transaction fees, leaving liquidity providers without earnings. It’s recommended that
liquidity providers check the **transactionFee** and **protocolFee** methods of pools before
providing liquidity to ensure that protocol fees are not too big.


## Informational
### Avoid using magic numbers
The codebase extensively uses magic numbers to denote fixed-decimal numbers (e.g.
uint256(1) << 128, uint256(1) << 16, uint256(1) << 96, uint256(1) << 192). To make it easier to
understand the meaning of the number when reading the code, consider extracting them into
libraries and giving them meaningful names. For example, uint256(1) << 128 can be named
**Q128** to clarify that the number represents the fractional decimals of a Q-number.

### Distinguish Q-numbers
The codebase uses Q-numbers and performs mathematical operations on them. To make it
easier to distinguish variables holding Q-numbers from other variables, consider adding
suffixed to variables with Q-numbers. For example, the pool’s **sqrtInterestRate** (which stores
a Q64.96 number) can be named **sqrtInterestRateX96** to make it clear that this is a Q-number
with 96 bits in the fractional part. This will make reading and checking mathematical
operations with Q-numbers easier.
It’s also recommended to document each Q-number’s type in function arguments. In the
audited code, only Pool.sqrtInterestRate is documented to be a UQ64.96.

### Integration tests to simulate main user workflows
There are no tests that involve setup of the Options, Pool, and Token contracts and testing
that different ways Timeswap is used like:
1. User borrowing
2. User lending
3. User providing liquidity
4. Liquidity provider collecting fees
5. Lender collecting principal and yield after maturity
6. Borrower repaying before maturity
The scenarios above are the main ways we identified Timeswap is used and there are more
tests that can be written that cover failure paths and possibly other identified edge cases.
Integration tests make it easier to change code that have cross-contract effects and serve as
reference for auditors or new developers to understand how the contracts are meant to be
used.
 
 ### Documentation website uses different terminology from the actual code
The documentation website refers to Collateral Claim Tokens and Bond Tokens, for example,
but none of those terms are used in the codebase. There is an additional layer of translation if you want a high-level understanding of the codebase from reading the documentation.
Ideally, the codebase uses the same terms as the documentation website. At the least, the
website documentation or documentation in the code should have a glossary that translates
terms in the documentation to the variables or fields used in the code.
