### Attacker can drain protocol tokens by sandwich attacking owner call to `setPositionWidth` and `unpause` to force redeployment of Beefy's liquidity into an unfavorable range

**Description:** When the owner of the `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` contract calls `setPositionWidth` and `unpause` an attacker can sandwich attack these calls to drain the protocol's tokens. This is possible because `setPositionWidth` and `unpause` redeploy Beefy's liquidity into a new range based off the current tick and don't check the `onlyCalmPeriods` modifier, so an attacker can use this to force Beefy to re-deploy liquidity into an unfavorable range.

**Impact:** Attacker can sandwich attack owner call to `setPositionWidth` and `unpause` to drain protocol tokens.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Two options:
* add the `onlyCalmPeriods` modifier to `setPositionWidth` and `unpause`,
* alternatively add the `onlyCalmPeriods` modifier to `_setTicks` and remove it from other functions

The second option seems preferable because:
* it reduces the possibility of forgetting to put the modifier on one particular function
* it makes logical sense as the attack vector is having the protocol refresh its ticks from `pool.slot0` then deploying liquidity when the pool has been manipulated
* it prevents any intra-function pool manipulation; if the modifier is at the start of a long function there may be a possibility that another entity (such as a malicious pool) could hook execution control during one of the external function calls to manipulate the pool after the `onlyCalmPeriods` check has passed (at the beginning of the function) but before Beefy refreshes its ticks and deploys the liquidity.

**Beefy:**
Fixed in commit [2c5f4cb](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/commit/2c5f4cb8d026bd7d4e842c993e032be507714b85) and [d7a7251](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/commit/d7a7251270e678e536d017011afc3123d70f916b).

**Cyfrin:** Verified.

### No slippage parameter on UniswapV3 swaps can be exploited by MEV to return fewer output tokens

**Description:** `UniV3Utils::swap` performs a [swap](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/interfaces/exchanges/UniV3Utils.sol#L22) with `amountOutMinimum: 0`. This function is called by `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::_chargeFees` [L375](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L375), [L389](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L389) and `BeefyQIVault::_swapRewardsToNative` [L223](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/qidao/BeefyQIVault.sol#L223).

**Impact:** Due to the [lack of slippage parameter](https://dacian.me/defi-slippage-attacks#heading-no-slippage-parameter) an MEV attacker could sandwich attack the swap to return fewer output tokens to the protocol than would otherwise be returned. For `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` the reduced output tokens applies to the protocol's fees.

Whether the attack will be profitable or not will depend on the gas cost the attacker has to pay; it may well be that on L2s and Alt-L1s where Beefy intends to deploy, it will be profitable to exploit these swaps with the small pool manipulation `onlyCalmPeriods` may allow because the gas costs are so low.

Combined with a lack of effective deadline timestamp, malicious validators could also hold the swap transaction and execute it at a later time when it would return a reduced token amount than if it had been executed immediately. The `onlyCalmPeriods` check wouldn't appear to provide any protection against this since the swap would still be executed in a calm period, just at a later time when it would return less tokens than the caller expected when they called it.

The previous state could also arise organically due to a sudden and sustained spike in gas costs for example from a popular and prolonged NFT mint; the transaction could be organically delayed and executed at a later time resulting in a worse swap than would have occurred had it been executed when it was supposed to.

**Recommended Mitigation:** A valid slippage parameter [ideally calculated off-chain](https://dacian.me/defi-slippage-attacks#heading-on-chain-slippage-calculation-can-be-manipulated) should be passed to the swap.

**Beefy:**
Acknowledged - known issue. Problem lies in the price being manipulated and then harvest being called would still result in a bad trade even with slippage protections. We harvest frequently to make sure the viability of this attack is mitigated. Also this is only resulting in less fees for the protocol, not the users.

## Medium Risk


### `block.timestamp` used as swap deadline offers no protection

**Description:** `UniV3Utils::swap` performs a [swap](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/interfaces/exchanges/UniV3Utils.sol#L20) with `deadline: block.timestamp`. This function is called by `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::_chargeFees` [L375](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L375), [L389](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L389) and `BeefyQIVault::_swapRewardsToNative` [L223](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/qidao/BeefyQIVault.sol#L223).

**Impact:** The block the transaction is eventually put into will be `block.timestamp` so this [offers no protection](https://dacian.me/defi-slippage-attacks#heading-no-expiration-deadline).

**Recommended Mitigation:** Caller should pass in a desired deadline which should be passed to the swap as the deadline parameter.

**Beefy:**
Acknowledged - known issue.


### Native tokens permanently stuck in `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` contract due to rounding in `_chargeFees`

**Description:** `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::_chargeFees` converts LP fees into the native token then distributes the native tokens split between:
* the caller as a reward for initiating the harvest
* beefy protocol
* the strategist registered with the strategy

However due to [rounding during division](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L397-L404) some tokens are not distributed but instead accumulate inside the `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` contract where they are permanently stuck.

**Impact:** Fees will accumulate inside the `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` contract where they are permanently stuck. Although the amount each time is small the effect is cumulative, especially given that this protocol is intended to be deployed on the many blockchains where Beefy currently operates.

### `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` gives ERC20 token allowances to `unirouter` but doesn't remove allowances when `unirouter` is updated

**Description:** `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` gives ERC20 token [allowances](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L745-L748) to `unirouter`:
```solidity
function _giveAllowances() private {
    IERC20Metadata(lpToken0).forceApprove(unirouter, type(uint256).max);
    IERC20Metadata(lpToken1).forceApprove(unirouter, type(uint256).max);
}
```

`unirouter` is inherited from `StratFeeManagerInitializable` which has an external function `setUnirouter` which allows `unirouter` to be [changed](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/beefy/StratFeeManagerInitializable.sol#L127-L130):
```solidity
 function setUnirouter(address _unirouter) external onlyOwner {
    unirouter = _unirouter;
    emit SetUnirouter(_unirouter);
}
```

The allowances can only be removed by [calling](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L726-L729) `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::panic` however `unirouter` can be changed any time via the `setUnirouter` function.

This allows the contract to enter a state where `unirouter` is updated via `setUnirouter` but the ERC20 token approvals given to the old `unirouter` are not removed.

**Impact:** The old `unirouter` contract will continue to have ERC20 token approvals for `StratFeeManagerInitializable` so it can continue to spend the protocol's tokens when this is not the protocol's intention as the protocol has changed `unirouter`.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 1) Make `StratFeeManagerInitializable::setUnirouter` `virtual` such that it can be overridden by child contracts.
2) `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` should override `setUnirouter` to remove all allowances before calling the parent function to update `unirouter`.

### Update to `StratFeeManagerInitializable::beefyFeeConfig` retrospectively applies new fees to pending LP rewards yet to be claimed

**Description:** The fee configuration `StratFeeManagerInitializable::beefyFeeConfig` can be updated via `StratFeeManagerInitializable::setBeefyFeeConfig` [L164-167](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/beefy/StratFeeManagerInitializable.sol#L164-L167) while LP rewards are collected and fees charged via `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::_harvest` [L306-311](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L306-L311).

This allows the protocol to enter a state where the fee configuration is updated to for example increase Beefy's protocol fees, then the next time `harvest` is called the higher fees are retrospectively applied to the LP rewards that were pending under the previously lower fee regime.

**Impact:** The protocol owner can retrospectively alter the fee structure to steal pending LP rewards instead of distributing them to protocol users; the retrospective application of fees is unfair on protocol users because those users deposited their liquidity into the protocol and generated LP rewards at the previous fee levels.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 1) `StratFeeManagerInitializable::setBeefyFeeConfig` should be declared virtual
2) `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` should override it and before calling the parent function, first call `_claimEarnings` then `_chargeFees`

This ensures that pending LP rewards are collected and have the correct fees charged on them, and only after that has happened is the new fee structure updated.

### Missing storage gap in `StratFeeManagerInitializable` can lead to upgrade storage slot collision

**Description:** `StratFeeManagerInitializable` is a stateful [upgradeable](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/beefy/StratFeeManagerInitializable.sol#L9) contract with no storage gaps and has [1 child](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L18) with its own state `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap`.

**Impact:** Should an upgrade occur where the `StratFeeManagerInitializable` contract has additional state added to storage, a storage collision can occur where storage within the child contract `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` is overwritten.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add a storage gap to the `StratFeeManagerInitializable` contract per the OpenZeppelin [documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#storage-gaps).

### Upgradeable contracts don't call `disableInitializers`

**Description:** The codebase has a number of upgradeable contracts which use OpenZeppelin Initializable but don't have a constructor which calls `_disableInitializers` per the OpenZeppelin documentation [[1](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-_disableInitializers--), [2](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#initializing_the_implementation_contract)].

**Impact:** Contract implementations could be initialized when this should not be possible.

**Recommended Mitigation:** All upgradeable contracts should have a constructor like this:
```solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

### Owner of `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` can rug-pull users' deposited tokens by manipulating `onlyCalmPeriods` parameters

**Description:** While `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` does have some permissioned roles, one of the attack paths we were asked to check was that the permissioned roles could not rug-pull the users' deposited tokens. There is a way that the owner of the `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` contract could accomplish this by modifying key parameters to reduce the effectiveness of the `_onlyCalmPeriods` check. This appears to be how a similar protocol Gamma was [exploited](https://rekt.news/gamma-strategies-rekt/).

**Proof of Concept:**
1. Owner calls `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::setDeviation` to increase the maximum allowed deviations to large numbers or alternatively `setTwapInterval` to decrease the twap interval rendering it ineffective
2. Owner takes a flash loan and uses it to manipulate `pool.slot0` to a high value
3. Owner calls `BeefyVaultConcLiq::deposit` to perform a deposit; the shares are calculated thus:
```solidity
// @audit `price` is derived from `pool.slot0`
shares = _amount1 + (_amount0 * price / PRECISION);
```
4. As `price` is derived from `pool.slot0` which has been inflated, the owner will receive many more shares than they normally would
5. Owner unwinds the flash loan returning `pool.slot0` back to its normal value
6. Owner calls `BeefyVaultConcLiq::withdraw` to receive many more tokens than they should be able to due to the inflated share count they received from the deposit

**Impact:** Owner of `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` can rug-pull users' deposited tokens.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Beefy already intends to have all owner functions behind a timelocked multi-sig and if these transactions are attempted the suspicious parameters would be an obvious signal that a future attack is coming. Because of this the probability of this attack being effectively executed is low though it is still possible.

One way to further mitigate this attack would be to have a minimum required twap interval and maximum required deviation amounts such that the owner couldn't change these parameters to values which would enable this attack.

### `_onlyCalmPeriods` does not consider MIN/MAX ticks, which can DOS deposit, withdraw and harvest in edge cases

**Description:** In Uniswap V3 liquidity providers can only provide liquidity between price ranges `[1.0001^{MIN_ TICK};1.0001^{MAX_TICK})`. Therefore these are the min and max prices.

```solidity
    function _onlyCalmPeriods() private view {
        int24 tick = currentTick();
        int56 twapTick = twap();

        if(
            twapTick - maxTickDeviationNegative > tick  ||
            twapTick + maxTickDeviationPositive < tick) revert NotCalm();
    }
```

If `twapTick - maxTickDeviationNegative < MIN_TICK`, this function would revert even if `tick` has been the same for years. This can DOS deposits, withdrawals and harvests when they should be allowed for as long as the state holds.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider changing the current implementation to:

```diff
+   const int56 MIN_TICK = -887272;
+   const int56 MAX_TICK = 887272;
    function _onlyCalmPeriods() private view {
        int24 tick = currentTick();
        int56 twapTick = twap();

+       int56 minCalmTick = max(twapTick - maxTickDeviationNegative, MIN_TICK);
+       int56 maxCalmTick = min(twapTick - maxTickDeviationPositive, MAX_TICK);

        if(
-           twapTick - maxTickDeviationNegative > tick  ||
-           twapTick + maxTickDeviationPositive < tick) revert NotCalm();
+           minCalmTick > tick  ||
+           maxCalmTick < tick) revert NotCalm();
    }
```

### `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::withdraw` should call `_setTicks` before calling `_addLiquidity`

**Description:** When a withdraw is initiated, `BeefyVaultConcLiq::withdraw` [calls](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L213) `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::beforeAction` which removes the liquidity.

In 4 other places when liquidity has been removed, `_setTicks` is always called immediately before calling `_addLiquidity` [[1](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L181-L182), [2](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L315-L316), [3](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L717-L718), [4](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L740-L741)].

This pattern does not occur inside `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::withdraw` [L204](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L204) where liquidity gets removed but then `_setTicks` is not called before adding liquidity again.

Consider the following scenario:

1. Beefy sets their LP position based on the current tick
2. Other users transact in the Uniswap pool moving the current liquidity range possibly even outside of Beefy's LP range
3. Someone interacts with Beefy protocol. On almost every interaction Beefy removes their liquidity, gets the current tick and deploys its new liquidity range calculated off the current tick.
4. But on withdrawals Beefy would remove its liquidity but then deploy its new liquidity range using the old stored current tick data since it doesn't fetch the new current tick.

In the above scenario could Beefy deploy its new LP range in an area where it wouldn't get any rewards since the actual current range moved outside it due the activity of other users.

**Impact:** Whenever withdrawals occur the newly added liquidity can be based off a stale current tick. The most likely result of this is reduced liquidity provider rewards due to a non-optimal LP position.

**Recommended Mitigation:** `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::withdraw` should call `_setTicks` before calling `_addLiquidity`.

**Beefy:**
We chose to remove the `_onlyCalmPeriods` check from `withdraw` in commit [be0f1ea](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/commit/be0f1eac6944d6f8f73d74a8c3ec80ae3bc3d089) to allow users to withdraw at any time. Hence we don't want withdraw to be able to set ticks so that a malicious actor can't force us to deploy liquidity into an unfavorable range.


### First depositor can massively inflate their share count by recycling deposits and withdrawals

**Description:** The first depositor can massively inflate their share count by recycling deposits and withdrawals.

**Impact:** The first depositor will have a massively inflated share count. However a subsequent depositor will also end up with a large share count, so we haven't found a way to exploit this to steal tokens from subsequent depositors.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Rework the `token1EquivalentBalance` calculation in `BeefyVaultConcLiq::deposit` [L178-179](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L178-L179).

**Beefy:**
We believe this is working as intended due to sending some of the shares from the first depositor to the burn address.


### `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::price` will revert due to overflow for large but valid `sqrtPriceX96`

**Description:** The maximum value of `sqrtPriceX96` is [1461446703485210103287273052203988822378723970342](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/libraries/TickMath.sol#L16) but `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::price` will revert due to overflow for values much lower than this.

**Impact:** Functionality such as deposits which depend on `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::price` will revert resulting in denial of service.

**Proof of Concept:** A stand-alone Foundry fuzz test:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

    uint256 private constant PRECISION = 1e36;

    function price(uint160 sqrtPriceX96) internal pure returns (uint256 _price) {
        _price = FullMath.mulDiv(uint256(sqrtPriceX96) ** 2, PRECISION, (2 ** 192));
    }

    function test_price(uint160 sqrtPriceX96) external {
        price(sqrtPriceX96);
    }
}
```

Running it shows the overflow:
```solidity

**Cyfrin:** Verified that the function no longer reverts. The fix does introduce a slight precision loss as illustrated by this stand-alone stateless fuzz test:
```solidity

        _price = FullMath.mulDiv(uint256(sqrtPriceX96) ** 2, PRECISION, (2 ** 192));
    }

    function newPrice(uint160 sqrtPriceX96) internal pure returns (uint256 _price) {
        _price = FullMath.mulDiv(uint256(sqrtPriceX96), Math.sqrt(PRECISION), (2 ** 96)) ** 2;

    function test_price(uint160 sqrtPriceX96) external {

which produces the following output:

### Withdraw can return zero tokens while burning a positive amount of shares

**Description:** Invariant fuzzing found an edge-case where a user could burn an amount of shares > 0 but receive zero output tokens. The cause appears to be a rounding down to zero precision loss for small `_shares` value in `BeefyVaultConcLiq::withdraw` [L220-221](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L220-L221):
```solidity
uint256 _amount0 = (_bal0 * _shares) / _totalSupply;
uint256 _amount1 = (_bal1 * _shares) / _totalSupply;
```

**Impact:** Protocol can enter a state where a user burns their shares but receives zero output tokens in return.

**Proof of Concept:** Invariant fuzz testing suite supplied at the conclusion of the audit.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Change the slippage check to also revert if no output tokens are returned:
```solidity
if (_amount0 < _minAmount0 || _amount1 < _minAmount1 ||
   (_amount0 == 0 && _amount1 == 0)) revert TooMuchSlippage();
```

**Beefy:**
Fixed in commit [04acaee](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/commit/04acaeecca9a69f0cc1399dac68da21fcf598f17).

**Cyfrin:** Verified.


### Deposit can return zero shares when user deposits a positive amount of tokens

**Description:** Stateless fuzzing found an edge-case where a user could deposit an amount of tokens > 0 but receive zero output shares. The cause appears to be either a rounding down to zero precision loss in the share calculation [L179](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L179) due to small amounts or the subtraction of the minimum share amount [L182](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L182) from the first depositor, combined with no zero share check after this occurs.

Interestingly `BeefyVaultConcLiq::deposit` does have a check to prevent zero shares [L173](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L173) being minted but the share amount is subsequently modified after this check occurs.

**Impact:** Protocol can enter a state where a user deposits a positive amount of tokens but receives zero output shares in return.

**Proof of Concept:** Add this test file `test/forge/ConcLiqTests/ConcLiqWBTCUSDC.t.sol`:

### Some tokens will be stuck in the protocol forever

**Description:** Due to the shares donated by the first depositor, some tokens will never be able to be withdrawn but will instead be stuck in the protocol forever.

**Impact:** Some tokens will be permanently stuck in the protocol.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement an "end-of-life" state for the protocol which:
1) can only be called by the owner when `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` is paused and `BeefyVaultConcLiq::totalSupply == MINIMUM_SHARES` (in this state all users have withdrawn and liquidity has been removed)
2) sends all remaining tokens to `StratFeeManagerInitializable::beefyFeeRecipient`
3) puts the protocol into an "end-of-life" state such that no further functions can be executed

**Beefy:**

This price is used in a number of functions such as `_addLiquidity` [L217](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L217), `_checkAmounts` [L283](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L283), `balancesOfPool` [L452](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L452), `_setAltTick` [L601](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L601) and `price` [L535](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L535) and in `BeefyVaultConcLiq::previewDeposit` [L117](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L117) and `deposit` [L170](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L170) while the current tick is used to calculate the LP range.

`pool.slot0` can be [easily manipulated](https://solodit.xyz/issues/h-10-ichilporacle-is-extemely-easy-to-manipulate-due-to-how-ichivault-calculates-underlying-token-balances-sherlock-blueberry-blueberry-git) via flash loans to return arbitrary value price and tick values. In Beefy's case this can allow an attacker to force the protocol to deploy its liquidity into an unfavorable range.

Beefy is aware of this risk and has implemented an [`_onlyCalmPeriods`](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L96-L102) function that prevents many functions from working if the pool has been abruptly manipulated. However as our Critical finding has shown, any asymmetry in the implementation of `_onlyCalmPeriods` can lead to the protocol being drained.

Hence we note the use of `pool.slot0` as a risk for this codebase as it continues to evolve, especially around functions that set the LP range from the current tick and deploy the protocol's liquidity.

### `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::twapInterval` should be `uint32`

**Description:** Given that `twapInterval` corresponds to a time interval it makes better sense to define it to as `uint32`, avoiding possible wrong assignment through `setTwapInterval` which can affect behavior of `twap()`.

**Beefy:**
Fixed in commit [b520517](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/commit/b520517486fa88da062116f6327ee938dd0b4fb4).

**Cyfrin:** Verified.


### Consider enforcing a min TWAP interval in `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::setTwapInterval` to avoid dangerous assignment

**Description:** The way TWAP oracle works in UniswapV3 is:

$$tickCumulative(pool,time_{A},time_{B}) = \sum_{i=time_{A}}^{time_{B}} Price_{i}(pool)$$

$$TWAP(pool,time_{A},time_{B}) = \frac{tickCumulative(pool,time_{A},time_{B})}{time_{B} - time_{A}}$$

In this way, if $time_{B} - time_{A}$ is too low it would be relatively easy to manipulate TWAP output. Since $time_{B} - time_{A}$ is represented by `twapInterval`, it would be better to enforce a min value, for instance 5 minutes (consider that current Ethereum blocks emission rate is around 12 seconds).

**Beefy:**
Fixed in commit [b5769c4](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/commit/b5769c4ccad6357ac9d3de2c682749bbaeeae6d1).

### Use existing `price` function in `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::_setAltTick`

**Description:** `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` has a `price` function that [converts](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L534-L537) `sqrtPriceX96` returned by uniswap `pool.slot0`.

Refactor `_setAltTick` [L601-604](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/uniswap/StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap.sol#L601-L604) to use the existing `price` function to reduce code duplication and the possibility for errors creeping in when implementing the same functionality in multiple places:

```solidity
if (bal0 > 0) {
    amount0 = bal0 * price() / PRECISION;
}
```

This also allows for the removal of the `price1` variable declaration inside `_setAltTick`.

**Beefy:**
Fixed in commit [b5b609e](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/commit/b5b609ec38938b15dc20a5ac187111019b82ebc5).

**Cyfrin:** Verified.


### Use existing `available` function in `BeefyVaultConcLiq::balances`

**Description:** `BeefyVaultConcLiq` has an `available` function that [returns](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L91-L94) the token balances held by the vault contract.

Refactor `balances` [L81-83](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L81-L83) to use the existing `available` function to reduce code duplication and the possibility for errors creeping in when implementing the same functionality in multiple places.

One possible refactoring:
```solidity
(uint256 stratBal0, uint256 stratBal1) = IStrategyConcLiq(strategy).balances();
(uint256 vaultBal0, uint256 vaultBal1) = available();
return (stratBal0 + vaultBal0, stratBal1 + vaultBal1);
```

**Beefy:**
In commit [38ee643](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/commit/38ee643ab661aba48f73b673ef2c8ed5ac63ed00) we removed the available function and exclude vault balances, as they are not accounted for in deposit or withdraw functions. They can be rescued by an owner function if for some reason someone sends tokens to the vault contract.


### Rename `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::price` to `scaledUpPrice` to explicitly indicate returned price is scaled up

**Description:** The current implementation of function `price` returns the price scaled up but the function name doesn't indicate this. Other places in the code that use this function do scale the price down, but the risk is that in the future as the protocol continues to evolve another developer may call the `price` function without realizing the returned price is scaled up and hence won't scale it down.

**Recommended mitigation:**
Rename the function to `scaledUpPrice` such that the function callers are explicitly informed they need to scale it down.

**Beefy:**
Fixed in commit [319cfa0](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/commit/319cfa013263bdab8790bebaa041737e30f52c3b).

**Cyfrin:** Verified.


### Use `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` instead of `OwnableUpgradeable`, `Ownable2Step` instead of `Ownable`

**Description:** `StratFeeManagerInitializable` and `BeefyVaultConcLiq` should use `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` instead of `OwnableUpgradeable`.

`StrategyFactory` should use `Ownable2Step` instead of `Ownable`.

The 2-step ownable contracts are to be preferred for [safer](https://www.rareskills.io/post/openzeppelin-ownable2step) ownership transfers.

**Beefy:**

### Use a specific version of Solidity instead of a wide version

**Description:** `StratFeeManagerInitializable` should use `pragma solidity 0.8.23;` instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.23;`.

### Optimize `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::_chargeFees` to remove unnecessary variables and eliminate duplicate storage reads

**Description:** `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::_chargeFees` uses two unnecessary variables `out0` and `out1` and reads the same storage values from `lpToken0`, `lpToken` and `native` multiple times. A more optimized version of the relevant section looks like this:

```solidity
// @audit cache `native` to prevent duplicate storage reads
address nativeCached = native;

/// We calculate how much to swap and then swap both tokens to native and charge fees.
uint256 nativeEarned;
if (_amount0 > 0) {
    // Calculate amount of token 0 to swap for fees.
    uint256 amountToSwap0 = _amount0 * fees.total / DIVISOR;
    _amountLeft0 = _amount0 - amountToSwap0;

    // @audit next section refactored
    // If token0 is not native, swap to native the fee amount.
    if (lpToken0 != nativeCached) nativeEarned += UniV3Utils.swap(unirouter, lpToken0ToNativePath, amountToSwap0);

    // Add the native earned to the total of native we earned for beefy fees, handle if token0 is native.
    else nativeEarned += amountToSwap0;
}

if (_amount1 > 0) {
    // Calculate amount of token 1 to swap for fees.
    uint256 amountToSwap1 = _amount1 * fees.total / DIVISOR;
    _amountLeft1 = _amount1 - amountToSwap1;

    // @audit next section refactored
    // Add the native earned to the total of native we earned for beefy fees, handle if token1 is native.
    if (lpToken1 != nativeCached) nativeEarned += UniV3Utils.swap(unirouter, lpToken1ToNativePath, amountToSwap1);

    // Add the native earned to the total of native we earned for beefy fees, handle if token1 is native.
    else nativeEarned += amountToSwap1;
}

// @audit then use `nativeCached` in the transfers eg:
IERC20Metadata(nativeCached).safeTransfer(_callFeeRecipient, callFeeAmount);

### Don't call `_tickDistance` twice in `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::_setMainTick`

**Description:** `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::_setMainTick` calls `_tickDistance` twice even though there is no need since the exact same value will be returned; replace the second call with the `distance` variable which caches the result of the first call like so:
```solidity
    function _setMainTick() private {
        int24 tick = currentTick();
        int24 distance = _tickDistance();
        int24 width = positionWidth * distance;
        (positionMain.tickLower, positionMain.tickUpper) = TickUtils.baseTicks(
            tick,
            width,
            // @audit use cached result from first call
            distance                 // _tickDistance()
        );
    }
```

### In `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` public functions should cache common inputs then pass them as parameters to private functions

**Description:** `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` has many private functions which read the same values from storage multiple times without changing them. Since reading from storage is gas expensive, these values could be read from storage once then passed into private functions as inputs.

Example 1 - `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap::_setMainTick` and `_setAltTick` use many of the same inputs; instead of reading them from storage multiple times, read them once inside `_setTicks` then pass them in as input parameters to `_setMainTick, _setAltTick`:

```solidity
function _setTicks() private {
    // @audit reading inputs only once
    int24 currTick = currentTick();
    int24 distance = _tickDistance();
    int24 width    = positionWidth * distance;

    // @audit passing inputs as parameters to avoid
    // multiple identical storage reads
    _setMainTick(currTick, distance, width);
    _setAltTick(currTick, distance, width);
}
```

Example 2 - `beforeAction` calls `_claimEarnings` and `_removeLiquidity`. Both of these private functions read `pool`, `positionMain` and `positionAlt` from storage but don't modify these storage locations. Hence `beforeAction` could read these values from storage once then pass them in as inputs to `_claimEarnings` and `_removeLiquidity` in order to save many useless but expensive storage reads.

### Avoid unnecessary initialization to zero in `BeefyVaultConcLiq::deposit`

**Description:** `BeefyVaultConcLiq::deposit` declares the `shares` variable on [L127](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L157) initializing it to zero even though the `shares` variable is first used later in [L172](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L172).

Avoid unnecessary initialization to zero by declaring and initializing `shares` at the same time in L172:
```solidity
uint256 shares = _amount1 + (_amount0 * price / PRECISION);
```

### Fail fast in `BeefyVaultConcLiq:withdraw`

**Description:** In `BeefyVaultConcLiq:withdraw` the `minAmount0` and `minAmount1` [slippage check](https://github.com/beefyfinance/experiments/blob/14a313b76888581b05d42b6f7b6097c79f3e65c6/contracts/protocol/concliq/vault/BeefyVaultConcLiq.sol#L225) should be before the call to `strategy.withdraw`, because there's no point in doing the additional processing if the function is going to revert. Make it like this:
```solidity
uint256 _amount0 = (_bal0 * _shares) / _totalSupply;
uint256 _amount1 = (_bal1 * _shares) / _totalSupply;

// @audit fail fast
if (_amount0 < _minAmount0 || _amount1 < _minAmount1) revert TooMuchSlippage();

strategy.withdraw(_amount0, _amount1);
