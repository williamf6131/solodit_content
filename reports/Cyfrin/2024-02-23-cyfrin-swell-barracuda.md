### `SwellLib.BOT` can delete active validators when bot methods are paused

**Description:** Almost all of the functions callable by `SwellLib.BOT` contain the following check to prevent bot functions from working when bot methods are paused:

```solidity
if (AccessControlManager.botMethodsPaused()) {
  revert SwellLib.BotMethodsPaused();
}
```

The one exception is [`NodeOperatorRegistry::deleteActiveValidators`](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/NodeOperatorRegistry.sol#L417-L423) which is callable by `SwellLib.BOT` even when bot methods are paused. Consider:
* adding a similar check to this function such that `SwellLib.BOT` is not able to call it when bot methods are paused
* alternatively add an explicit comment to this function stating that it should be callable by `SwellLib.BOT` even when bot methods are paused.

One possible implementation for the first solution:
```solidity
bool isBot = AccessControlManager.hasRole(SwellLib.BOT, msg.sender);

// prevent bot from calling this function when bot methods are paused
if(isBot && AccessControlManager.botMethodsPaused()) {
  revert SwellLib.BotMethodsPaused();
}

// function only callable by admin & bot
if (!AccessControlManager.hasRole(SwellLib.PLATFORM_ADMIN, msg.sender) && !isBot) {
  revert OnlyPlatformAdminOrBotCanDeleteActiveValidators();
}
```

### `SwellLib.BOT` can subtly rug-pull withdrawals by setting `_processedRate = 0` when calling `swEXIT::processWithdrawals`

**Description:** When users create a withdrawal request, their `swETH` is [burned](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swEXIT.sol#L202-L205) then the current exchange rate `rateWhenCreated` is [fetched](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swEXIT.sol#L213) from `swETH::swETHToETHRate`:
```solidity
uint256 rateWhenCreated = AccessControlManager.swETH().swETHToETHRate();
```

However `SwellLib.BOT` can [pass an arbitrary value](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swEXIT.sol#L111) for `_processedRate` when calling `swEXIT::processWithdrawals`:
```solidity
function processWithdrawals(
  uint256 _lastTokenIdToProcess,
  uint256 _processedRate
) external override checkRole(SwellLib.BOT) {
```

The [final rate](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swEXIT.sol#L150-L152) used is the lesser of `rateWhenCreated` and `_processedRate`:
```solidity
uint256 finalRate = _processedRate > rateWhenCreated
  ? rateWhenCreated
  : _processedRate;
```

This final rate is [multiplied](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swEXIT.sol#L158) by the requested withdrawal amount to determine the actual amount sent to the user requesting a withdrawal:
```solidity
uint256 requestExitedETH = wrap(amount).mul(wrap(finalRate)).unwrap();
```

Hence `SwellLib.BOT` can subtly rug-pull all withdrawals by setting `_processedRate = 0` when calling `swEXIT::processWithdrawals`.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Two possible mitigations:
1) Change `swEXIT::processWithdrawals` to always fetch the current rate from `swETH::swETHToETHRate`
2) Only allow `swEXIT::processWithdrawals` to be called by the `RepricingOracle` contract which [calls it correctly](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/RepricingOracle.sol#L130-L132).

## Low Risk


### Precision loss in `swETH::reprice` from unnecessary division before multiplication

**Description:** `swETH::reprice` [L281-286](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L281-L286) performs unnecessary [division before multiplication](https://dacian.me/precision-loss-errors#heading-division-before-multiplication) when calculating node operator rewards which negatively impacts node operator rewards due to precision loss:

```solidity
UD60x18 nodeOperatorRewardPortion = wrap(nodeOperatorRewardPercentage)
  .div(wrap(rewardPercentageTotal));

nodeOperatorRewards = nodeOperatorRewardPortion
  .mul(rewardsInSwETH) // @audit mult after division
  .unwrap();
```

Refactor to perform division after multiplication:

```solidity
nodeOperatorRewards = wrap(nodeOperatorRewardPercentage)
  .mul(rewardsInSwETH)
  .div(wrap(rewardPercentageTotal))
  .unwrap();
```

A similar issue occurs when calculating operators reward share [L310-313](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L310-L313):

```solidity
uint256 operatorsRewardShare = wrap(operatorActiveValidators)
  .div(totalActiveValidators)
  .mul(wrap(nodeOperatorRewards)) // @audit mult after division
  .unwrap();
```

This can be similarly refactored to prevent the precision loss by performing multiplication first:

```solidity
uint256 operatorsRewardShare = wrap(operatorActiveValidators)
  .mul(wrap(nodeOperatorRewards))
  .div(totalActiveValidators)
  .unwrap();
```

This issue has not been introduced in the new changes but is in the mainnet code ([1](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-core-public/blob/master/contracts/lst/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L267-L272), [2](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-core-public/blob/master/contracts/lst/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L296-L299)).

There is still one potential precision loss remaining as `rewardsInSwETH` which has had a [division performed](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L239) then gets [multiplied](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L285) but attempting to refactor this out resulted in a "stack too deep" error so it may be unavoidable.

**Swell:** Acknowledged.


### `swEXIT::setWithdrawRequestMaximum` and `setWithdrawRequestMinimum` lacking validation can lead to a state where `withdrawRequestMinimum > withdrawRequestMaximum`

**Description:** Invariant `withdrawRequestMinimum <= withdrawRequestMaximum` must always hold, however this is not checked when new min/max withdraw values are set. Hence it is possible to enter a non-sensical state where `withdrawRequestMinimum > withdrawRequestMaximum`.

**Recommended mitigation:**
```diff
  function setWithdrawRequestMaximum(
    uint256 _withdrawRequestMaximum
  ) external override checkRole(SwellLib.PLATFORM_ADMIN) {
+   require(withdrawRequestMinimum <= _withdrawRequestMaximum);

    emit WithdrawalRequestMaximumUpdated(
      withdrawRequestMaximum,
      _withdrawRequestMaximum
    );
    withdrawRequestMaximum = _withdrawRequestMaximum;
  }

  function setWithdrawRequestMinimum(
    uint256 _withdrawRequestMinimum
  ) external override checkRole(SwellLib.PLATFORM_ADMIN) {
+   require(_withdrawRequestMinimum <= withdrawRequestMaximum);

    emit WithdrawalRequestMinimumUpdated(
      withdrawRequestMinimum,
      _withdrawRequestMinimum
    );
    withdrawRequestMinimum = _withdrawRequestMinimum;
  }
```

**Swell:** Fixed in commit [a9dfe5c](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/commit/a9dfe5cef35404e4e957e8001d571b1cf43feb0a).

### `swExit::getProcessedRateForTokenId` returns `true` with valid `processedRate` for non-existent `tokenId` input

**Description:** `swExit::getProcessedRateForTokenId` returns `true` with valid `processedRate` for non-existent `tokenId` input.

**Impact:** This `public` function can return valid output for invalid input. Currently it only appears to be used by `finalizeWithdrawal` where this behavior does not seem to be further exploitable as that function checks for non-existent tokens before calling `getProcessedRateForTokenId`.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following PoC to `getProcessedRateForTokenId.test.ts`:
```typescript
  it("Should return false for isProcessed when tokens have been processed but this token doesn't exist", async () => {
    await createWithdrawRequests(Deployer, 5);

    await swEXIT_Deployer.processWithdrawals(4, parseEther("1"));

    // @audit this test fails
    expect(await getProcessedRateForTokenId(0)).eql({
      isProcessed: false,               // @audit returns true
      processedRate: BigNumber.from(0), // @audit returns > 0
    });
  });
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** `swExit::getProcessedRateForTokenId` should `return(false, 0)` when `tokenId` doesn't exist. It appears that the only edge case which is currently unhandled by this function is when `tokenId = 0`.

**Swell:** Fixed in commits [4c8cbfd](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/commit/4c8cbfde6fdb54385f8bab83c33f90409fd0a412), [262db73](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/commit/262db7361f543611237e889313b8022a47b77144).

### Check for staleness of data when fetching Proof of Reserves via Chainlink `Swell ETH PoR` Oracle

**Description:** `RepricingOracle::_assertRepricingSnapshotValidity` [uses](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/RepricingOracle.sol#L329-L331) the `Swell ETH PoR` Chainlink Proof Of Reserves Oracle to fetch an off-chain data source for Swell's current reserves.

The Oracle `Swell ETH PoR` is [listed](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/proof-of-reserve/addresses?network=ethereum&page=1#networks) on Chainlink's website as having a heartbeat of `86400` seconds (check the "Show More Details" box in the top-right corner of the table), however [no staleness check](https://medium.com/SwellNetwork/chainlink-oracle-defi-attacks-93b6cb6541bf#99af) is implemented by `RepricingOracle`:
```solidity
// @audit no staleness check
(, int256 externallyReportedV3Balance, , , ) = AggregatorV3Interface(
  ExternalV3ReservesPoROracle
).latestRoundData();
```

**Impact:** If the `Swell ETH PoR` Chainlink Proof Of Reserves Oracle has stopped functioning correctly, `RepricingOracle::_assertRepricingSnapshotValidity` will continue processing with stale reserve data as if it were fresh.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement a staleness check and if the Oracle is stale, either revert or skip using it as the code currently does [if the oracle is not set](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/RepricingOracle.sol#L325-L327).

For multi-chain deployments ensure that a [correct staleness check is used for each feed](https://medium.com/SwellNetwork/chainlink-oracle-defi-attacks-93b6cb6541bf#fb78) as the same feed can have different heartbeats on different chains.

Consider adding an off-chain bot that periodically checks if the Oracle has become stale and if it has, raises an internal alert for the team to investigate.

### `swETH::reprice` may run out of gas or become exorbitantly expensive when scaling to large number of validator operators due to iterating over them all

**Description:** `swETH::reprice` [loops](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/tree/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L303-L321) through all validator operators to pay out their share of rewards:
```solidity
// @audit may run out of gas for larger number of validator operators
// or make repricing exorbitantly expensive
for (uint128 i = 1; i <= totalOperators; ) {
  (
    address rewardAddress,
    uint256 operatorActiveValidators
  ) = nodeOperatorRegistry.getRewardDetailsForOperatorId(i);

  if (operatorActiveValidators != 0) {
    uint256 operatorsRewardShare = wrap(operatorActiveValidators)
      .div(totalActiveValidators)
      .mul(wrap(nodeOperatorRewards))
      .unwrap();

    _transfer(address(this), rewardAddress, operatorsRewardShare);
  }

  // Will never overflow as the total operators are capped at uint128
  unchecked {
    ++i;
  }
}
```
If Swell scales to a large number of validators `swETH::reprice` may revert due to out of gas or make the reprice operation exorbitantly expensive. `NodeOperatorRegistry::getNextValidatorDetails` may be similarly [affected](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/c9a1e6c06d0f5b358f5c3d4b7644db7a33952444/contracts/implementations/NodeOperatorRegistry.sol#L117-L125).

Currently this represents a low risk for Swell as the protocol uses a small set of ["permissioned group of professional node operators"](https://docs.swellnetwork.io/swell/sweth-liquid-staking/sweth-v1.0-system-design/node-operators-set).

However Swell intends to [transition away from](https://docs.swellnetwork.io/swell/sweth-liquid-staking/sweth-v1.0-system-design/node-operators-set) this: _"The subsequent iterations will see the operator set **expand** and ultimately be permissionless.."_

As Swell expands the operator set this issue will become a more serious concern and may require mitigation.

**Swell:** Acknowledged.


### `NodeOperatorRegistry::updateOperatorControllingAddress` allows to override `_newOperatorAddress` if its address is already assigned to an operator ID

**Description:** Current implementation does not check if the new assigned address has already been assigned to an operator ID. As a consequence, its current value can be over written in mapping `getOperatorIdForAddress`, and `getOperatorForOperatorId` will have 2 operator IDs pointing to the same operator.

The direct consequences of this are on `_getOperatorSafe` and `_getOperatorIdSafe`, which will only return data for the new assigned operator ID.

Therefore:
* `NodeOperatorRegistry::getOperatorsPendingValidatorDetails` won't be able to return old `_newOperatorAddress` associated validators details
* `NodeOperatorRegistry::getOperatorsActiveValidatorDetails` won't be able to return old `_newOperatorAddress` associated active validators details
* `enableOperator` won't be able to enable old operator record
* **__`disableOperator` won't be able to disable old operator record__**.  This can affect function `usePubKeysForValidatorSetup` given that the protocol won't be able to disable already enabled public key to be used for validator setup given that there is no way to modify previous `getOperatorForOperatorId[_newOperatorAddress].enabled` storage and [force the function to revert](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/NodeOperatorRegistry.sol#L194-L196). Given that the only one allowed to call the function is the BOT by previously calling `DepositManager::setupValidators` the impact is limited.
* `updateOperatorRewardAddress` won't be able to modify reward address from old operator record
* `updateOperatorName` won't be able to modify name from old operator record

This issue has not been introduced in the new changes but is in the mainnet [code](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-core-public/blob/master/contracts/lst/contracts/implementations/NodeOperatorRegistry.sol#L348-L364).

**Proof Of Concept:**
Add the following test to `updateOperatorFields.test.ts`:
```typescript
    it("Should revert updating operator controlling address to existing address", async () => {
      // create another operator
      await NodeOperatorRegistry_Deployer.addOperator(
        "OPERATOR_2",
        NewOperator.address,
        NewOperator.address
      );

      // attempt to update first operator's controlling address to be
      // the same as the newly created operator - should revert but doesn't
      await NodeOperatorRegistry_Deployer.updateOperatorControllingAddress(
        Operator.address,
        NewOperator.address
      );
    });
```

**Recommended mitigation:**
Check that `_newOperatorAddress` is not already assigned to an operator (similar to `addOperator` which [already does this](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/NodeOperatorRegistry.sol#L300-L302), may wish to create a new private or public function for code reuse):
```diff
  function updateOperatorControllingAddress(
    address _operatorAddress,
    address _newOperatorAddress
  )
    external
    override
    checkRole(SwellLib.PLATFORM_ADMIN)
    checkZeroAddress(_newOperatorAddress)
  {

    if (_operatorAddress == _newOperatorAddress) {
        revert CannotSetOperatorControllingAddressToSameAddress();
    }
+   if(getOperatorIdForAddress[_newOperatorAddress] != 0){
+       revert CannotUpdateOperatorControllingAddressToAlreadyAssignedAddress();
+   }

    uint128 operatorId = _getOperatorIdSafe(_operatorAddress);

    getOperatorIdForAddress[_newOperatorAddress] = operatorId;
    getOperatorForOperatorId[operatorId]
      .controllingAddress = _newOperatorAddress;

    delete getOperatorIdForAddress[_operatorAddress];
  }
```

### Allowing anyone to finalize any withdrawal can lead to integration problems for smart contract allowed to receive ETH

**Description:** Current implementation of `swEXIT::finalizeWithdrawal` allows anyone to finalize any withdrawal request which is already processed. However this design decision make the strong assumption that an NFT owner always wants to finalize a withdrawal, which might not be always the case.

**Impact:** Allowing anyone to finalize any withdrawal request already processed can lead to stuck ETH in some smart contracts

**POC:**
Assume a protocol which goals is facilitating NFT auctions, with auctions that can accept any token or ETH. Bidders has a record for the amount of tokens/ETH they are offering for an NFT, so the smart contract implement a `receive` function to accept ETH.

Eve initiate a withdrawal request, but given that she urge for ETH she decide to use this protocol to sell her NFT in an auction. To do this, she must transfer the NFT to the auction contract.

Alice decide to bid for the NFT, and at the end of the auction she wins, now she has to claim the NFT (the auction contract is the owner of the NFT right now).

The swEXIT NFT is processed before Alice intend to claim it, Eve calls `finalizeWithdrawal` with the NFT in the auction contract, given that this contract is allowed to receive ETH and it is the NFT owner the transaction does not revert, and the ETH associated to the NFT now is stuck forever in the auction contract, Alice cannot claim nothing now.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Only allowed the owner of the NFT to finalize a withdrawal

```diff
    function finalizeWithdrawal(uint256 tokenId) external override {
        if (AccessControlManager.withdrawalsPaused()) {
        revert WithdrawalsPaused();
        }

        address owner = _ownerOf(tokenId);

-       if (owner == address(0)) {
-           revert WithdrawalRequestDoesNotExist();
+       if (owner == msg.sender) {
+           revert WithdrawalRequestFinalizationOnlyAllowedForNFTOwner();
        }
```

**Swell:** Fixed in commit [b5d7a19](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/commit/b5d7a19e2f6de5c0ae086c8deaac5166767cd3fd).

### Multiple attack paths to force `swETH::reprice` to revert by increasing or decreasing swETH total supply

**Description:** The current total swETH supply is [used](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L268-L273) in `swETH::reprice` to enforce the maximum allowed total swETH supply difference during repricings. Total supply can decrease for 2 reasons:
1. [Withdrawal being finalized](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swEXIT.sol#L205)
2. User calls [`swETH::burn`](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L350-L356) to burn their own swETH

Total supply can also increase by users calling `swETH::deposit`.

The closer the current supply difference is to the maximum tolerated difference percentage, the greater chance an attacker can front-run the repricing transaction causing it to revert by:
1. Depositing a large enough amount of ETH via `swETH::deposit` to increase total supply
2. Burning their own swETH to decrease total supply
3. Finalizing one or more withdrawals (users can finalize others withdrawals) to decrease total supply

**Recommended mitigation:**
Some possible mitigations include:
* Add a burner role and assigned it only to `swEXIT`, also add the corresponding modifier to check this role to `swETH::burn`
* Only allow the owner of an NFT to finalize their owned withdrawal requests

However these potential mitigations restrict functionality while still enabling an attacker to revert the reprice via the `swETH::deposit` route. Another option would be to have the bot perform the repricing transaction through a service such as [flashbots](https://www.flashbots.net/) such that the transaction can't be front-run; this would prevent all of the attack paths while still preserving the ability for users to burn their swETH and to finalize others withdrawals.

**Swell:** Using flashbots to perform repricing transactions.


### Rewards unable to be distributed when all active validators are deleted during repricing

**Description:** Invariant fuzzing found an interesting edge-case during repricing if:

1) there are rewards to distribute which were accrued in the last period,
2) all the current active validators are being deleted in the repricing operation

Because the validators are [deleted first](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/RepricingOracle.sol#L114-L122) the reprice transaction reverts with `NoActiveValidators` [error](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L298-L300).

No repricings will be possible until new active validators are added, and when that occurs the new validators will receive the rewards that were generated by the old validators which were deleted. Additionally Aaron confirmed on TG: _it is theoretically possible for fees to be generated without any active validators as any ETH sent to the `DepositManager` is considered rewards and eligible for fees._

**Recommended Mitigation:** During repricing if there are no active validators but rewards to be distributed, instead of reverting the rewards should go to the Swell treasury.

**Swell:** Fixed in commit [5594e20](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/commit/5594e204083a8507e69f0c28f4d1d7162f9a20fd).

### Repricing with small rewards results in an invalid state where `ETH` reserves increase, `swETH to ETH` exchange rate increases, but no rewards are paid out to operators or treasury

**Description:** Invariant fuzzing used repricings with small rewards to reach an invalid state where `ETH` reserves increase, `swETH : ETH` exchange rate increases, but no rewards are paid out to operators or treasury.

**Proof of Concept:** During repricing:
1) there is no minimum value enforced by either `RepricingOracle` for [`_snapshot.rewardsPayableForFees`](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/RepricingOracle.sol#L227) or `swETH::reprice` for `_newETHRewards`
2) in `swETH::reprice` there is no check for rounding down to zero precision loss when [calculating](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L239-L241) `rewardsInSwETH`

This results in the fuzzer reaching an invalid state where:
1) by calling `RepricingOracle::submitSnapshotV2` with small values for `_snapshot.rewardsPayableForFees`, this results in `swETH::reprice` being called with small `_newETHRewards`
2) inside `swETH::reprice` the small `_newETHRewards` triggers a rounding down to zero precision loss in the rewards calculation of `rewardsInSwETH` so [rewards are never distributed](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L278)
3) however `swETH::reprice` does [update](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L337) `lastRepriceETHReserves` using the small positive `_newETHRewards` value and the transaction completes successfully.

This results in an invalid state where:

1) `swETH::lastRepriceETHReserves` increases
2) `swETH : ETH` exchange rate increases
3) no rewards are being paid out to operators/treasury

### Precision loss in `swETH::_deposit` from unnecessary hidden division before multiplication

**Description:** `swETH::_deposit` [L170](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L170) contains a hidden unnecessary [division before multiplication](https://dacian.me/precision-loss-errors#heading-division-before-multiplication) as the call to `_ethToSwETHRate` performs a division which then gets multiplied by `msg.value`:
```solidity
uint256 swETHAmount = wrap(msg.value).mul(_ethToSwETHRate()).unwrap();
// @audit expanding this out
// wrap(msg.value).mul(_ethToSwETHRate()).unwrap();
// wrap(msg.value).mul(wrap(1 ether).div(_swETHToETHRate())).unwrap();
```

This issue has not been introduced in the new changes but is in the mainnet [code](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-core-public/blob/master/contracts/lst/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L170).

**Impact:** Slightly less `swETH` will be minted to depositors. While the amount by which individual depositors are short-changed is individually small, the effect is cumulative and increases as depositors and deposit size increase.

**Proof of Concept:** This stand-alone stateless fuzz test can be run inside Foundry to prove this as well as provided hard-coded test cases:

    uint256 private constant SWETH_ETH_RATE = 1050754209601187151; //as of 2024-02-15

    function _mintOriginal(uint256 inputAmount) private pure returns(uint256) {
        // hidden division before multiplication
        // wrap(inputAmount).mul(_ethToSwETHRate()).unwrap();
        // wrap(inputAmount).mul(wrap(1 ether).div(_swETHToETHRate())).unwrap()

        return wrap(inputAmount).mul(wrap(1 ether).div(wrap(SWETH_ETH_RATE))).unwrap();
    }

    function _mintFixed(uint256 inputAmount) private pure returns(uint256) {

        uint256 resultFixed    = _mintFixed(inputAmount);

        // found by fuzzer
        console.log(_mintFixed(3656923177187149889) - _mintOriginal(3656923177187149889)); // 1

        // 100 eth
        console.log(_mintFixed(100 ether) - _mintOriginal(100 ether)); // 21

        // 1000 eth

        console.log(_mintFixed(10000 ether) - _mintOriginal(10000 ether)); // 2159
    }
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Refactor to perform multiplication before division:
```solidity
uint256 swETHAmount = wrap(msg.value).mul(wrap(1 ether)).div(_swETHToETHRate()).unwrap();
```

### Emit `ETHSent` event when sending eth

### Use Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern in `swEXIT::createWithdrawRequest`

**Description:** The current implementation uses [`_safeMint`](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swEXIT.sol#L209) before modifying state variables:
* `withdrawalRequests[tokenId] `
* `exitingETH`
* `_lastTokenIdCreated`

This allows possible re-entrancy where the receiver and access the non-updated state variables. While during the audit no meaningful permissionless attack vectors related to this issue were found, to follow best security practices it is advisable to move `_safeMint` to the end of the function:

```diff
  function createWithdrawRequest(
    uint256 amount
  ) external override checkWhitelist(msg.sender) {
    if (AccessControlManager.withdrawalsPaused()) {
      revert WithdrawalsPaused();
    }

    if (amount < withdrawRequestMinimum) {
      revert WithdrawRequestTooSmall(amount, withdrawRequestMinimum);
    }

    if (amount > withdrawRequestMaximum) {
      revert WithdrawRequestTooLarge(amount, withdrawRequestMaximum);
    }

    IswETH swETH = AccessControlManager.swETH();
    swETH.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    // Burn the tokens first to prevent reentrancy and to validate they own the requested amount of swETH
    swETH.burn(amount);

-   uint256 tokenId = _lastTokenIdCreated + 1; // Start off at 1
+   uint256 tokenId = ++_lastTokenIdCreated; // Starts off at 1

-   _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId);

    uint256 lastTokenIdProcessed = getLastTokenIdProcessed();

    uint256 rateWhenCreated = AccessControlManager.swETH().swETHToETHRate();

    withdrawalRequests[tokenId] = WithdrawRequest({
      amount: amount,
      timestamp: block.timestamp,
      lastTokenIdProcessed: lastTokenIdProcessed,
      rateWhenCreated: rateWhenCreated
    });

    exitingETH += wrap(amount).mul(wrap(rateWhenCreated)).unwrap();
-   _lastTokenIdCreated = tokenId;
+   _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId);

    emit WithdrawRequestCreated(
      tokenId,
      amount,
      block.timestamp,
      lastTokenIdProcessed,
      rateWhenCreated,
      msg.sender
    );

  }
```

### Missing events in `NodeOperatorRegistry` update methods

**Description:** The following functions in `NodeOperatorRegistry` update multiple storage locations but don't emit any events:
* `updateOperatorControllingAddress`
* `updateOperatorRewardAddress`
* `updateOperatorName`

Consider emitting events in these functions to reflect the updates made to storage.

### Refactor identical code in `NodeOperatorRegistry::getNextValidatorDetails`

**Description:** The bodies of these two `else if` [branches](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/NodeOperatorRegistry.sol#L151-L162) are identical:

```solidity
} else if (foundOperatorId == 0) {
  // If no operator has been found yet set the smallest operator active keys to the current operator
  smallestOperatorActiveKeys = operatorActiveKeys;

  foundOperatorId = operatorId;

  // If the current operator has less keys than the smallest operator active keys, then we want to use this operator
} else if (smallestOperatorActiveKeys > operatorActiveKeys) {
  smallestOperatorActiveKeys = operatorActiveKeys;

  foundOperatorId = operatorId;
}
```

Hence the code can be simplified to:
```solidity
// If no operator has been found yet set the smallest operator active keys to the current operator
// If the current operator has less keys than the smallest operator active keys, then we want to use this operator
} else if (foundOperatorId == 0 ||
           smallestOperatorActiveKeys > operatorActiveKeys) {
  smallestOperatorActiveKeys = operatorActiveKeys;
  foundOperatorId = operatorId;
}
```

### `NodeOperatorRegistry::_parsePubKeyToString`: Use shift operations rather than division/multiplication when dividend/factor is a power of 2

**Description:** While `DIV` and `MUL` opcodes cost 5 gas unit each, shift operations cost 3 gas units. Therefore, `NodeOperatorRegistry::_parsePubKeyToString` can take advantage of them to save gas:

```diff
+   uint256 private SYMBOL_LENGTH = 16 // Because _SYMBOLS.length = 16
    function _parsePubKeyToString(
        bytes memory pubKey
    ) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        // Create the bytes that will hold the converted string
-      bytes memory buffer = new bytes(pubKey.length * 2);
+       // make sure that pubKey.length * 2 <= 2^256
+      bytes memory buffer = new bytes(pubKey.length << 1);

        bytes16 symbols = _SYMBOLS;
+       uint256 symbolLength = symbols.length;
+       uint256 index;
        for (uint256 i; i < pubKey.length; i++) {
-           buffer[i * 2] = symbols[uint8(pubKey[i]) / symbols.length];
-           buffer[i * 2 + 1] = symbols[uint8(pubKey[i]) % symbols.length];
+           index = i << 1; // i * 2
+           buffer[index] = symbols[uint8(pubKey[i]) >> 4]; // SYMBOL_LENGTH = 2^4
+           buffer[index + 1] = symbols[uint8(pubKey[i]) % SYMBOL_LENGTH];
        }

        return string(abi.encodePacked("0x", buffer));
    }
```

A more optimized version of this function looks like:
```solidity
bytes16 private constant _SYMBOLS = "0123456789abcdef";
uint256 private constant SYMBOL_LENGTH = 16; // Because _SYMBOLS.length = 16

function _parsePubKeyToString(bytes memory pubKey) internal pure returns (string memory) {
    // Create the bytes that will hold the converted string
    // make sure that pubKey.length * 2 <= 2^256
    uint256 pubKeyLength  = pubKey.length;
    bytes memory buffer   = new bytes(pubKeyLength << 1);

    uint256 index;
    for (uint256 i; i < pubKeyLength;) {
        index             = i << 1; // i * 2
        buffer[index]     = _SYMBOLS[uint8(pubKey[i]) >> 4]; // SYMBOL_LENGTH = 2^4
        buffer[index + 1] = _SYMBOLS[uint8(pubKey[i]) % SYMBOL_LENGTH];

        unchecked {++i;}
    }

    return string(abi.encodePacked("0x", buffer));
}
```

The following stand-alone test using Foundry & [Halmos](https://github.com/a16z/halmos/) verifies that the optimized version returns the same output as the original:

        bytes memory buffer = new bytes(pubKey.length * 2);

        bytes16 symbols = _SYMBOLS;

        // This conversion relies on taking the uint8 value of each byte, the first character in the byte is the uint8 value divided by 16 and the second character is modulo of the 16 division
        for (uint256 i; i < pubKey.length; i++) {
            buffer[i * 2] = symbols[uint8(pubKey[i]) / symbols.length];
            buffer[i * 2 + 1] = symbols[uint8(pubKey[i]) % symbols.length];
        }

        return string(abi.encodePacked("0x", buffer));

### Use `totalReserves - rewardsInETH.unwrap()` rather than `_preRewardETHReserves - rewardsInETH.unwrap() + _newETHRewards` in `swETH::reprice`

**Description:** Both result in the same output but the first expression saves a `SUB` opcode. In addition the suggested modification results in simpler code which better reflects the intention of the invariant.

### Remove redundant pause checks

**Description:** 1) Remove redundant `botMethodsPaused` [check](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swETH.sol#L208-L210) in `swETH::reprice` as:

* this function is only called by [`RepricingOracle::handleReprice`](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/RepricingOracle.sol#L233)
* `RepricingOracle::handleReprice` can only be called by [`submitSnapshot`](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/RepricingOracle.sol#L89-L94) and [`submitSnapshotV2`](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/RepricingOracle.sol#L105-L112) which both already contain the `botMethodsPaused` check.

2) Remove redundant `withdrawalsPaused` [check](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/swEXIT.sol#L117-L119) in `swEXIT::processWithdrawals` as this function is only supposed to be callable by `RepricingOracle` which already [contains](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/blob/a95ea7942ba895ae84845ab7fec1163d667bee38/contracts/implementations/RepricingOracle.sol#L129) the check.

**Swell:** Fixed in commits [1fca965](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/commit/1fca965019facc4dcc79c35bfc45c8a711043196), [3f85df3](https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-contracts-lst/commit/3f85df3ba0e91b26e4234b15ad94f492fa6d46ec).

### Refactor `RepricingOracle::handleReprice`, `_assertRepricingSnapshotValidity` and `_repricingPeriodDeltas`

**Description:** In `RepricingOracle::_assertRepricingSnapshotValidity` and `_repricingPeriodDeltas` there is a lot of logic around whether to use the old snapshot or not, based around if `upgradeableRepriceSnapshot.meta.blockNumber == 0`.

If the idea is that the first time repricing occurs after the upgrade the execution path is `useOldSnapshot = true` but after that every time it will be `useOldSnapshot = false`, then it may make more sense to create functions just for that first execution which will only run once, then have functions for all the normal cases which come afterwards. This would avoid the extra gas costs and also simplify the code for all the future normal cases after the first-time-call special case.

Gas costs can also be reduced by having `handleReprice` load the snapshot struct, cache `upgradeableRepriceSnapshot.meta.blockNumber`, calculate `useOldSnapshot` once then pass these in as inputs to `_assertRepricingSnapshotValidity` and `_repricingPeriodDeltas` eg:

```solidity

  function handleReprice(
    UpgradeableRepriceSnapshot calldata _snapshot
  ) internal {
    // only call getSnapshotStruct() once
    UpgradeableRepriceSnapshot
      storage upgradeableRepriceSnapshot = getSnapshotStruct();

    // only calculate these once and pass them as required
    uint256 ursMetaBlockNumber = upgradeableRepriceSnapshot.meta.blockNumber;
    bool useOldSnapshot = ursMetaBlockNumber == 0;

    // validation
    _assertRepricingSnapshotValidity(_snapshot, ursMetaBlockNumber, useOldSnapshot);

    _repricingPeriodDeltas(
          reserveAssets,
          _snapshot.state,
          _snapshot.withdrawState,
          upgradeableRepriceSnapshot,
          useOldSnapshot
        );

    // delete the call to getSnapshotStruct() near the end of handleReprice()
```


**Swell:** Acknowledged. Will be addressed in a future upgrade when the old snapshot is no longer relevant. Swell will continue to pay the excess gas costs in the meantime.


### Use constant for unchanging deposit amount

**Description:** In `DepositManager::setupValidators` there is no use in paying gas to declare then later read this variable which never changes:
```solidity
uint256 depositAmount = 32 ether;
```

Rather simply define a constant:
```solidity
uint256 private constant DEPOSIT_AMOUNT = 32 ether;
```
And use that constant instead.

**Swell:** Acknowledged.
