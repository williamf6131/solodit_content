### `GMXV2_Module` withdrawal functionality is broken due to missing callback implementation

**Description:** The `GMXV2_Module` contract's withdrawal functionality is broken because it sets itself (**`address(this)`**) as the callback contract for GMX V2 withdrawals without implementing the required callback interface. This causes all withdrawal transactions to revert, effectively locking user funds in the protocol.

```solidity
function gmxv2_withdraw(
    address market,
    uint256 executionFee,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minLongOut,
    uint256 minShortOut
) external payable onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) nonReentrant {
    IExchangeRouter.CreateWithdrawalParams memory params = IExchangeRouter.CreateWithdrawalParams({
        receiver: address(this),
        callbackContract: address(this),  // @audit - Setting callback without implementation
        // ...
    });
    // ...
}
```

According to GMX V2's documentation and source code, when a callback contract is specified, it must implement two critical functions:

1. `afterWithdrawalExecution(bytes32, WithdrawalUtils.Props, EventUtils.EventLogData)`
2. `afterWithdrawalCancellation(bytes32, WithdrawalUtils.Props)`

These callbacks are enforced by GMX's `ExecuteWithdrawalUtils.sol`:

```solidity
// In ExecuteWithdrawalUtils.sol
function executeWithdrawal(...) {
    // ... other code ...
    CallbackUtils.afterWithdrawalExecution(params.key, withdrawal, eventData);
    // ... other code ...
}

// In CallbackUtils.sol
function afterWithdrawalExecution(...) internal {
    if (withdrawal.callbackContract() != address(0)) {
        IWithdrawalCallbackReceiver(withdrawal.callbackContract()).afterWithdrawalExecution(
            key,
            withdrawal,
            eventData
        );
    }
}
```


**Impact:** This issue completely breaks a core protocol function. It has severe implications:

- **Complete loss of functionality**: All withdrawal transactions through `gmxv2_withdraw` will revert, making it impossible for users to withdraw their funds.
- **Loss of funds**: User funds become locked in the protocol.



**Proof of Concept:** We've created a test that demonstrates this issue:

```solidity
function test_gmxv2_withdraw_RevertGivenMissingCallback() public {
        // First make a deposit to get market tokens
        uint256 depositAmount = 1e18;
        deal(WETH_ADDRESS, address(strategy), depositAmount);
        vm.prank(address(strategy));
        _weth.approve(GMX_DEPOSIT_VAULT, depositAmount);

        // Store initial balance
        uint256 initialExecutorBalance = EXECUTOR.balance;

        // Get market info before deposit
        IMarket.Props memory marketInfo = IReader(GMX_READER).getMarket(GMX_DATASTORE, GMX_WETH_MARKET);
        address marketToken = marketInfo.marketToken;

        // Execute deposit
        vm.prank(EXECUTOR);
        _gmx.gmxv2_deposit{value: 0.1 ether}(
            GMX_WETH_MARKET,
            0.1 ether,  // execution fee
            depositAmount,
            0,          // no short token
            0           // min out
        );

        // Deal market tokens to the vault first before simulating keeper execution
        deal(marketToken, GMX_DEPOSIT_VAULT, depositAmount);

        // ============ KEEPER SIMULATION - DEPOSIT EXECUTION ============
        // In production: GMX keeper would execute this step
        // Here we simulate the keeper minting market tokens to the strategy
        vm.prank(GMX_DEPOSIT_VAULT);
        IERC20(marketToken).transfer(address(strategy), depositAmount); // Simulate market tokens being minted
        // ============ END KEEPER SIMULATION - DEPOSIT EXECUTION ============

        // Get market token balance after deposit
        uint256 marketTokenBalance = IERC20(marketToken).balanceOf(address(strategy));

        require(marketTokenBalance > 0, "No market tokens received from deposit");

        // Approve market tokens for withdrawal
        vm.prank(address(strategy));
        IERC20(marketToken).approve(GMX_WITHDRAW_VAULT, depositAmount);

        // Now attempt to withdraw
        vm.prank(EXECUTOR);
        _gmx.gmxv2_withdraw{value: 0.1 ether}(
            GMX_WETH_MARKET,
            0.1 ether,  // execution fee
            depositAmount,
            0,          // min long out
            0           // min short out
        );

        // Deal WETH to the withdraw vault before simulating keeper execution
        deal(WETH_ADDRESS, GMX_WITHDRAW_VAULT, depositAmount * 2); // Ensure vault has enough WETH

        // First give market tokens to the strategy
        deal(marketToken, address(strategy), depositAmount);

        // ============ KEEPER SIMULATION - WITHDRAWAL EXECUTION ============
        // In production: GMX keeper would:
        // 1. Burn market tokens
        // 2. Return WETH
        // 3. Call the callback contract (if set) with afterWithdrawalExecution
        // Here we simulate steps 1 and 2 manually:
        vm.startPrank(GMX_WITHDRAW_VAULT);
        // Step 1: Burn market tokens (transfer them to withdraw vault)
        IERC20(marketToken).transferFrom(address(strategy), GMX_WITHDRAW_VAULT, depositAmount);
        // Step 2: Return WETH to strategy
        IERC20(WETH_ADDRESS).transfer(address(strategy), depositAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // Note: Step 3 (callback) is not simulated as we're bypassing GMX's actual execution
        // ============ END KEEPER SIMULATION - WITHDRAWAL EXECUTION ============


        // Verify executor spent the execution fees
        assertEq(
            EXECUTOR.balance,
            initialExecutorBalance - 0.2 ether, // 0.1 for deposit + 0.1 for withdrawal
            "Executor should have spent 0.2 ETH for execution fees"
        );
    }
```

The test passes, but this is misleading because we're manually simulating the keeper's actions. In production, according to [GMX V2's documentation](https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics#withdrawal-notes), withdrawals require specific callback handling:

> "Ensure only handlers with the CONTROLLER role can call the afterWithdrawalExecution and afterWithdrawalCancellation callback functions"

This indicates that GMX V2 expects contracts interacting with withdrawals to implement these callback functions. When our contract attempts a withdrawal in production:
1. The keeper will attempt to call `afterWithdrawalExecution` on our contract
2. Since we don't implement this interface, the transaction will revert
3. The withdrawal will fail, leaving user funds stuck in the protocol

Our test passes only because we're bypassing GMX's actual withdrawal execution by manually simulating the token transfers, which skips the mandatory callback mechanism.

**Recommended Mitigation:** There are two possible fixes:

**Option 1: Remove Callback (Recommended)**
If no post-withdrawal processing is needed:

```solidity
IExchangeRouter.CreateWithdrawalParams memory params = IExchangeRouter.CreateWithdrawalParams({
    receiver: address(this),
    callbackContract: address(0),  // Set to zero address to skip callbacks
    // ...
});
```

**Option 2: Implement Callback Interface**
If post-withdrawal processing is required, implement the IWithdrawalCallbackReceiver interface:

```solidity
contract GMXV2_Module is IGMXV2_Module, IWithdrawalCallbackReceiver {
    function afterWithdrawalExecution(
        bytes32 key_,
        WithdrawalUtils.Props memory withdrawal_,
        EventUtils.EventLogData memory eventData_
    ) external {
        // Add post-withdrawal logic
    }

    function afterWithdrawalCancellation(
        bytes32 key_,
        WithdrawalUtils.Props memory withdrawal_
    ) external {
        // Add cancellation logic
    }
}
```

We recommend Option 1 (removing the callback) unless there's a specific need for post-withdrawal processing, as it's simpler and requires less gas.

### `PRIVATE_KEY` exposed in `makefile` file and other sensitive data

**Description:** The project's Makefile contains hardcoded sensitive credentials including:

- A private key used for contract deployments
- Multiple RPC endpoint URLs with API keys
- Several Etherscan API keys for different networks

**Impact:** Although no customer funds were at risk and the deployer key had no admin rights on any of the deployed strategies, this exposure is critical because:

1. The private key grants complete control over the associated address, including:
    - Full access to any funds held by the wallet
    - Impersonate the protocol and deploy fake vaults
2. The RPC endpoints could be used to:
    - Execute unauthorized API calls
    - Potentially incur costs to the project
    - Exceed rate limits affecting production services

**Recommended Mitigation:** Immediate Actions Required:
- Remove all exposed credentials immediately
- Transfer any assets from the compromised address
- Revoke any contract permissions from the address
- Regenerate all API keys

Future mitigation use methods in this Updraft [lesson](https://updraft.d2sd2s.io/courses/foundry/foundry-simple-storage/never-use-a-env-file?lesson_format=video) to safely store private keys.

### Users may lose value when transferring ERC-4626 Vault tokens cross-chain

**Description:** Both the `VaultV0` and `VaultV3` ERC-4626 tokens are designed to be transferable across chains and therefore implement the LayerZero cross-chain OFT standard.

When a token is transferred cross-chain, the `_debit` function is called to determine how the token should be "removed" from the source chain. The two standard approaches for this are **Lock/Unlock** and **Mint/Burn**. Both `VaultV0` and `VaultV3` implement the **Mint/Burn** approach, as seen in [`VaultV0::_debit` and `VaultV0::_credit`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/VaultV0.sol#L384-L393) (with an identical implementation in [`VaultV3`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/VaultV3.sol#L321-L330)):

```solidity
function _debit(address _from, uint256 _amountLD, uint256 _minAmountLD, uint32 _dstEid) internal virtual override returns (uint256 amountSentLD, uint256 amountReceivedLD) {
    (amountSentLD, amountReceivedLD) = _debitView(_amountLD, _minAmountLD, _dstEid);
    _burn(_from, amountSentLD);
}

function _credit(address _to, uint256 _amountLD, uint32) internal virtual override returns (uint256 amountReceivedLD) {
    if (_to == address(0x0)) _to = address(0xdead);
    _mint(_to, _amountLD);
    return _amountLD;
}
```

However, this approach is problematic for ERC-4626 vaults because `_burn` reduces the `totalSupply`. Since share value is calculated as `assets / totalSupply`, transferring tokens to another chain increases the share value of stakers who still have their tokens on the vault's original chain. This means that if these stakers withdraw, they will receive a portion of the assets that originally belonged to users who transferred their tokens cross-chain.

**Impact:** Cross-chain transfers distort the vault’s share value. Users who transfer their tokens risk losing part or all of their value if other users withdraw while their tokens are still in transit.

**Proof of Concept:** The following test shows the issue, a similar test was written for `VaultV3`:
```solidity
function test_vaultV0_xchain_transfer_affects_vault_exchange_rate() public {
    deal(address(asset), DEPOSITOR, 2e18);

    // 1. Bob and Alice both participate in the vault
    vm.startPrank(DEPOSITOR);
    asset.approve(address(vault), 2e18);
    vault.deposit(1e18, ALICE);
    vault.deposit(1e18, BOB);
    assertEq(vault.balanceOf(ALICE), 1e18);
    assertEq(vault.balanceOf(BOB), 1e18);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // 2. Share price is not 1 to 1
    assertEq(vault.previewRedeem(1e18), 1e18);

    SendParam memory sendParam;
    sendParam.to = bytes32(uint256(1));
    sendParam.amountLD = 1e18;

    MessagingFee memory fee;

    // 3. Bob transfers his share to another chain
    vm.prank(BOB);
    vault.send(sendParam, fee, BOB);

    // Since the share is burnt on the source chain, share price has increased
    assertEq(vault.previewRedeem(1e18), 2e18);

    // 4. Alice redeems her share, getting Bobs share as well
    vm.prank(ALICE);
    vault.redeem(1e18,ALICE, ALICE);

    assertEq(vault.balanceOf(ALICE), 0);
    assertEq(asset.balanceOf(ALICE), 2e18);

    Origin memory origin;
    origin.sender = bytes32(uint256(1));
    (bytes memory message,) = OFTMsgCodec.encode(
        bytes32(uint256(uint160(BOB))),
        1e6,
        ""
    );

    // 5. Bob transfers back
    vm.prank(LZ_ENDPOINT);
    vault.lzReceive(
        origin,
        bytes32(uint256(0)),
        message,
        LZ_ENDPOINT,
        ""
    );

    // Bobs share is now worth nothing as Alice has redeemed it
    assertEq(vault.balanceOf(BOB), 1e18);
    assertEq(vault.previewRedeem(1e18), 0);

    vm.prank(BOB);
    vm.expectRevert("ZERO_ASSETS");
    vault.redeem(1e18, BOB, BOB);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider using the **Lock/Unlock** approach and custody the funds in the vault when transferred:
```solidity
function _debit(address _from, uint256 _amountLD, uint256 _minAmountLD, uint32 _dstEid) internal virtual override returns (uint256 amountSentLD, uint256 amountReceivedLD) {
    (amountSentLD, amountReceivedLD) = _debitView(_amountLD, _minAmountLD, _dstEid);
    // Instead of burning, transfer to this contract
    _transfer(_from, address(this), amountSentLD);
}

function _credit(address _to, uint256 _amountLD, uint32) internal virtual override returns (uint256 amountReceivedLD) {
    if (_to == address(0x0)) _to = address(0xdead);
    _transfer(address(this),_to, _amountLD);
    return _amountLD;
}
```

### Reward claiming fails for Berachain RewardVaults due to incorrect interface

**Description:** D2 plans to deploy on the newly launched Berachain, which operates on a novel [Proof-of-Liquidity](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/what-is-proof-of-liquidity) model. On Berachain, liquidity providers can stake their LP tokens in [Reward Vaults](https://docs.berachain.com/developers/contracts/reward-vault) to earn `$BGT`, the Berachain Governance Token.

To facilitate staking and withdrawals, the D2 [`Bera_Module`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Bera.sol) includes the functions [`Bera_Module::bera_vault_stake`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Bera.sol#L66-L68) and [`Bera_Module::bera_vault_withdraw`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Bera.sol#L70-L72). To claim `$BGT` rewards, the [`Bera_Module::bera_vault_get_reward`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Bera.sol#L74-L76) function is used:

```solidity
function bera_vault_get_reward(address token) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) nonReentrant {
    IVault(vaultFactory.getVault(token)).getReward(address(this));
}
```

However, the interface used for [`IVault::getReward`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Bera.sol#L221) is incorrect:

```solidity
function getReward(address account) external;
```

In Berachain’s [`RewardVault::getReward`](https://github.com/berachain/contracts/blob/main/src/pol/rewards/RewardVault.sol#L318-L321) and as deployed on-chain, the correct function signature is:

```solidity
function getReward(
    address account,
    address recipient
)
```

Due to this discrepancy, any call to `Bera_Module::bera_vault_get_reward` will revert, preventing `$BGT` rewards from being claimed.

**Impact:** The `$BGT` rewards, which are a core incentive of Berachain's Proof-of-Liquidity model, cannot be claimed. This reduces the protocol's ability to effectively participate in Berachain’s reward system. Additionally, since these rewards contribute to the protocol's overall earnings.

**Proof of Concept:** The following test highlights the issue:
```solidity
function test_bera_vault_get_reward() public {
    deal(USDCe_HONEY_STABLE_ADDRESS, address(strategy), 1e18);

    vm.startPrank(EXECUTOR);
    trader.approve(USDCe_HONEY_STABLE_ADDRESS, USDCe_HONEY_STABLE_VAULT, 1e18);
    bera.bera_vault_stake(USDCe_HONEY_STABLE_ADDRESS, 1e18);

    assertEq(RewardVault(USDCe_HONEY_STABLE_VAULT).balanceOf(address(strategy)), 1e18);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);

    // there are rewards to be claimed
    assertGt(RewardVault(USDCe_HONEY_STABLE_VAULT).earned(address(strategy)), 0);

    // rewards cannot be claimed due to the interface definition being wrong
    vm.expectRevert();
    bera.bera_vault_get_reward(USDCe_HONEY_STABLE_ADDRESS);

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider adding the extra parameter to the interface and call it with `address(this)`:
```diff
-   IVault(vaultFactory.getVault(token)).getReward(address(this));
+   IVault(vaultFactory.getVault(token)).getReward(address(this), address(this));
```

**D2:** Fixed in [`92303a6`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/commit/92303a61653ff5564df0c143afcd7298e14a33b9)

### Lack of slippage protection allows exploitation of Pendle trades

**Description:** The [`Pendle_Module`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Pendle.sol) is designed to interact with the Pendle protocol. [Pendle](https://pendle.finance/) is a permissionless yield-trading protocol that enables users to execute various yield-management strategies. It utilizes a complex system of different token types—`PT`, `YT`, and `SY`—to facilitate trading across different components of yield.

Within Pendle, users can deposit assets to receive these tokens and subsequently swap between them. The `Pendle_Module` facet implements these functionalities.

The issue, however, is that slippage protection is completely absent, as the slippage parameters are hardcoded to `0` in multiple functions:
* [`Pendle_Module::pendle_deposit`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Pendle.sol#L35-L74), [L69](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Pendle.sol#L69):

Since all these functions allow transactions with zero slippage protection, they may be exploited by MEV bots causing value loss for the stakers in D2.

**Impact:** The absence of slippage protection exposes the protocol to front-running and price manipulation. Attackers can take advantage of these hardcoded zero values to extract value from trades at the expense of D2’s stakers, leading to potential financial losses.


**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider allowing the trader to provide `minAmountOut` in the calls.

### Unsafe token transfers in `VaultV3` can lead to state inconsistencies

**Description:** The `VaultV3` contract doesn't validate the success of token transfers in both `custodyFunds()` and `returnFunds()` functions. State changes occur before or regardless of transfer success, which can lead to vault state inconsistencies.

```solidity
function custodyFunds() external onlyTrader notCustodied duringEpoch returns (uint256) {
    uint256 amount = totalAssets();
    require(amount > 0, "!amount");
    custodied = true;
    custodiedAmount = amount;
    IERC20(asset()).transfer(trader, amount); // No success validation
    emit FundsCustodied(epochId, amount);
    return amount;
}

function returnFunds(uint256 _amount) external onlyTrader {
    require(custodied, "!custody");
    require(_amount > 0, "!amount");
    IERC20(asset()).transferFrom(trader, address(this), _amount); // No success validation
    epoch.epochEnd = uint80(block.timestamp);
    custodied = false;
    emit FundsReturned(currentEpoch, _amount);
}

```

**Impact:** Even with a trusted trader, several non-malicious scenarios can trigger this issue:

1. Token transfers being temporarily paused (e.g., USDC during SVB crisis)
2. Missing or insufficient allowances for transferFrom
3. Token blacklisting or transfer limits
4. Token implementations that return false instead of reverting

When triggered, this can lead to:

- Vault becoming stuck in custodied state
- Incorrect epoch transitions
- Mismatched accounting of assets
- Temporary locking of user funds
- Need for manual governance intervention

**Recommended Mitigation:** Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library and follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

contract VaultV3 {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    function custodyFunds() external onlyTrader notCustodied duringEpoch returns (uint256) {
        uint256 amount = totalAssets();
        require(amount > 0, "!amount");
        custodied = true;
        custodiedAmount = amount;
        IERC20(asset()).safeTransfer(trader, amount);
        emit FundsCustodied(epochId, amount);
        return amount;
    }

    function returnFunds(uint256 _amount) external onlyTrader {
        require(custodied, "!custody");
        require(_amount > 0, "!amount");
        epoch.epochEnd = uint80(block.timestamp);
        custodied = false;
        IERC20(asset()).safeTransferFrom(trader, address(this), _amount);
        emit FundsReturned(currentEpoch, _amount);
    }
}

### Incorrect `chainid` prevents correct Strategy deployment on Berachain

**Description:** The Strategy contract includes a special configuration specifying which facets should be used for different chains. However, the `chainid` assigned to Berachain is incorrect, as seen in  [`Strategy::constructor`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/Strategy.sol#L25-L337), [L216](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/Strategy.sol#L216):
```solidity
} else if (block.chainid == 80000) { // @audit Berachain id is 80094
```
According to the [official documentation](https://docs.berachain.com/developers/network-configurations), the correct `chainid` for Berachain is `80094`, not `80000`.

**Impact:** Facets intended for deployment on Berachain will not be correctly initialized until a new Strategy contract is deployed with the corrected `chainid`. This prevents the expected functionality from being executed on Berachain.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider changing `chainid` to `80094`:
```diff
- } else if (block.chainid == 80000) {
+ } else if (block.chainid == 80094) {
```

### Incorrect interface for `ExchangeRouter::updateOrder` prevents order updates in GMX V2

**Description:** There is an issue in the integration with the GMX V2 trading platform, specifically in the [`GMX_Module::gmxv2_update`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/GMXV2.sol#L140-L148) function:
```solidity
function gmxv2_update(
    bytes32 key,
    uint256 sizeDeltaUsd,
    uint256 acceptablePrice,
    uint256 triggerPrice,
    uint256 minOutputAmount
) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) nonReentrant {
    exchangeRouter.updateOrder(key, sizeDeltaUsd, acceptablePrice, triggerPrice, minOutputAmount);
}
```

The issue arises from an incorrect interface definition for [`ExchangeRouter::updateOrder`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/GMXV2.sol#L383-L389):

```solidity
function updateOrder(
    bytes32 key,
    uint256 sizeDeltaUsd,
    uint256 acceptablePrice,
    uint256 triggerPrice,
    uint256 minOutputAmount
) external payable;
```

However, the actual function signature used by GMX in its [`ExchangeRouter`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x900173a66dbd345006c51fa35fa3ab760fcd843b#code) is:

```solidity
function updateOrder(
    bytes32 key,
    uint256 sizeDeltaUsd,
    uint256 acceptablePrice,
    uint256 triggerPrice,
    uint256 minOutputAmount,
    uint256 validFromTime,
    bool autoCancel
) external payable nonReentrant {
```

The discrepancy between the expected and actual function signatures means that calls to `GMX_Module::gmxv2_update` will always revert due to missing parameters.

**Impact:** The `gmxv2_update` function is non-functional and will always revert, preventing order updates. While this issue can be circumvented by closing and reopening positions, this workaround is inefficient and leads to unnecessary transaction costs.

**Proof of Concept:** The following test highlights the issue:
```solidity
function test_gmxv2_update_SucceedGivenValidOrder() public {
    // First create a long position
    uint256 collateralAmount = 1e18;
    uint256 sizeDeltaUsd = 10000e30;
    uint256 initialTriggerPrice = 2500e30;  // Current ETH price
    uint256 initialAcceptablePrice = 2400e30;  // Lower than trigger price for market long (willing to pay up to this price)
    uint256 initialMinOutputAmount = 0.9e18;
    uint256 executionFee = 0.1 ether;

    // Deal WETH to the strategy
    deal(WETH_ADDRESS, address(strategy), collateralAmount);

    // Create the order
    vm.prank(address(strategy));
    _weth.approve(GMX_ORDER_VAULT, collateralAmount);

    vm.recordLogs();
    // Create a market increase order
    vm.prank(EXECUTOR);
    _gmx.gmxv2_create{value: executionFee}(
        GMX_WETH_MARKET,
        WETH_ADDRESS,
        new address[](0), // No swap path
        IExchangeRouter.OrderType.LimitIncrease,
        IExchangeRouter.DecreasePositionSwapType.NoSwap,
        true, // isLong
        sizeDeltaUsd,
        collateralAmount,
        initialTriggerPrice,
        initialAcceptablePrice,
        initialMinOutputAmount,
        executionFee
    );
    Vm.Log[] memory entries = vm.getRecordedLogs();

    // Get the order key
    bytes32 key = entries[5].topics[2];

    // Wait for a few blocks to ensure order is ready
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 hours);
    vm.roll(block.number + 100);

    // New parameters for the update
    uint256 newSizeDeltaUsd = 20000e30;
    uint256 newAcceptablePrice = 2200e30;
    uint256 newTriggerPrice = 2050e30;
    uint256 newMinOutputAmount = 0.95e18;

    // Record initial executor balance
    uint256 initialBalance = EXECUTOR.balance;

    // Update the order
    // This will fail because the interface used is not the correct one
    vm.prank(EXECUTOR);
    _gmx.gmxv2_update(
        key,
        newSizeDeltaUsd,
        newAcceptablePrice,
        newTriggerPrice,
        newMinOutputAmount
    );

    // Verify the executor spent the correct amount of ETH for execution fees
    assertEq(
        EXECUTOR.balance,
        initialBalance,
        "Executor balance should not change for updates"
    );
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider changing the interface and adding the extra parameters to the call.

### `Bera_Module` fails to stake in `BGTStaker` due to missing Boost integration

**Description:** The D2 Berachain integration includes two functions, [`Bera_Module::bera_bgt_stake`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Bera.sol#L54-L56) and [`Bera_Module::bera_bgt_withdraw`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Bera.sol#L58-L60). These functions attempt to interact with [`BGTStaker::stake`](https://github.com/berachain/contracts/blob/main/src/pol/BGTStaker.sol#L93-L96) and [`BGTStaker::withdraw`](https://github.com/berachain/contracts/blob/main/src/pol/BGTStaker.sol#L98-L101), respectively.

However, both `BGTStaker::stake` and `BGTStaker::withdraw` can only be called by the `BGT` token contract itself, as enforced by the [`onlyBGT`](https://github.com/berachain/contracts/blob/main/src/pol/BGTStaker.sol#L58-L62) modifier:

```
/// @dev Throws if called by any account other than BGT contract.
modifier onlyBGT() {
    if (msg.sender != address(stakeToken)) NotBGT.selector.revertWith();
    _;
}
...

function stake(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyBGT {
    _stake(account, amount);
}
```

To stake in `BGTStaker`, a user must use the **boost functionality** on the `BGT` token. This involves:
1. Calling [`BGT::queueBoost`](https://github.com/berachain/contracts/blob/main/src/pol/BGT.sol#L216-L227) and [`BGT::activateBoost`](https://github.com/berachain/contracts/blob/main/src/pol/BGT.sol#L241-L266) to boost a verifier.
2. Calling [`BGT::queueDropBoost`](https://github.com/berachain/contracts/blob/main/src/pol/BGT.sol#L268-L276) and [`BGT::dropBoost`](https://github.com/berachain/contracts/blob/main/src/pol/BGT.sol#L285-L306) to exit the boost.

More details about boosting verifiers can be found in the Berachain [documentation](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/tokens/bgt#boosting-validators-incentives).

**Impact:** The protocol will not be able to earn `$BGT` rewards from `BGTStaker` as intended. To access these rewards, it must integrate with the boost functionality of the `BGT` token instead of calling `BGTStaker` directly. This oversight could result in missed staking incentives, reducing the protocol's overall earnings.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider implementing the boost functionality on the BGT token

**D2:** Fixed in [`11c9407`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/commit/11c9407644df2830f562cc60f4e0bfc1263459d3)

### `Bera_Module::bera_kodiakv3_swap` broken due to `deadline` parameter

**Description:** The function `Bera_Module::bera_kodiakv3_swap` calls Kodiak's `SwapRouter02::exactInput` (which is similar to Uniswap V3) to execute a swap:
```solidity
function bera_kodiakv3_swap(address token, uint amount, uint amountMin, bytes calldata path) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) nonReentrant {
    validateToken(token);
    IERC20(token).approve(address(kodiakv3swap), amount);
    kodiakv3swap.exactInput(IKodiakV3.ExactInputParams({
        path: path,
        recipient: address(this),
        deadline: type(uint256).max,
        amountIn: amount,
        amountOutMinimum: amountMin
    }));
}
```
However, the `deadline` parameter is included in the function call but is not present in the [`SwapRouter02.ExactInputParams`](https://berascan.com/address/0xe301e48f77963d3f7dbd2a4796962bd7f3867fb4#code) struct:

```solidity
struct ExactInputParams {
    bytes path;
    address recipient;
    uint256 amountIn;
    uint256 amountOutMinimum;
}
```

As a result, any call to `Bera_Module::bera_kodiakv3_swap` will always revert due to the mismatched function parameters.

**Impact:** Swaps executed through Kodiak V3 will fail entirely, as every transaction using `bera_kodiakv3_swap` will revert.

**Proof of Concept:** The following test will fail and highlights the issue:
```solidity
function test_bera_kodiakv3_swap() public {
    deal(WBERA_ADDRESS, address(strategy), 1e18);

    bytes memory path = abi.encodePacked(WBERA_ADDRESS, uint24(3000), HONEY_ADDRESS);

    vm.prank(EXECUTOR);
    bera.bera_kodiakv3_swap(
        WBERA_ADDRESS,
        1e18,
        0,
        path
    );

    assertGt(HONEY.balanceOf(address(strategy)),0);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider removing the `deadline` parameter from `IKodiakV3.ExactInputParams`. Also, consider adding a separate `deadline` that can be passed to the call to ensure proper deadline handling, as discussed in issue _7.4.3 Improper deadline handling_.


**D2:** Fixed in [`84dbcf9`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/commit/84dbcf92e7a8a4d84b68d39e8726281660aee2b7)

### Kodiak swap functions do not check if output token is approved, risking stuck assets

**Description:** In the swap implementations within `Inch_Module`, both the input token and output token are validated to ensure they are approved before executing a swap. This validation is present in [`inch_swap`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Inch.sol#L48-L59), [`inch_uniswapV3Swap`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Inch.sol#L61-L84), and [`inch_clipperSwap`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Inch.sol#L86-L105).

However, this validation is missing in both [`Bera_Module::bera_kodiakv2_swap`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/main/contracts/modules/Bera.sol#L120-L130) and [`Bera_Module::bera_kodiakv3_swap`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/main/contracts/modules/Bera.sol#L188-L198).

As a result, the trader (`EXECUTOR_ROLE`) could accidentally or intentionally swap to a non-approved token. Since this token **cannot be swapped back, it would remain stuck in the Strategy contract, making it inaccessible.

**Impact:** If a trader swaps into a non-approved token, it would become irreversibly stuck in the contract, as it cannot be swapped back.

**Proof of Concept:** The following test highlights the issue:
```solidity
function test_bera_kodiakv2_swap_to_non_allowed_token() public {
    deal(WBERA_ADDRESS, address(strategy), 1e18);

    address[] memory path = new address[](2);
    path[0] = WBERA_ADDRESS;
    path[1] = RAMEN_TOKEN_ADDRESS; // not allowed

    vm.startPrank(EXECUTOR);
    bera.bera_kodiakv2_swap(
        WBERA_ADDRESS,
        1e18,
        0,
        path
    );

    uint256 ramenBalance = ERC20(RAMEN_TOKEN_ADDRESS).balanceOf(address(strategy));
    assertGt(ramenBalance,0);

    path[0] = RAMEN_TOKEN_ADDRESS;
    path[1] = WBERA_ADDRESS;

    // token cannot be swapped back
    vm.expectRevert("Invalid token");
    bera.bera_kodiakv2_swap(
        RAMEN_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
        ramenBalance,
        0,
        path
    );
    vm.stopPrank();

    // balance still left in contract
    assertEq(ERC20(RAMEN_TOKEN_ADDRESS).balanceOf(address(strategy)), ramenBalance);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider validating both input token _and_ output token. As is done in the `Inch_Module` swaps.

**D2:** Fixed in [`c70268c`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/commit/c70268ca43bb3417958f72e51d7773f95425ca6e)

## Low Risk


### Aave’s module lacks reward-claiming functionality

**Description:** The D2 protocol's Aave integration lacks reward claiming functionality in the Aave_Module.sol contract. While the protocol successfully interacts with Aave's lending and borrowing features, it does not implement any mechanism to claim or distribute rewards earned from these activities.

The contract lacks both the interface definition and implementation for interacting with Aave's IncentivesController, which is necessary for claiming rewards. As a result, any rewards accrued from lending and borrowing activities remain locked in the Aave protocol.

**Impact:** The absence of reward claiming functionality leads to several consequences:

1. **Permanent Loss of Value**
    - All rewards earned from lending and borrowing activities are effectively locked in the Aave protocol
    - These rewards accumulate but remain inaccessible to both users and the protocol
    - The value is permanently stranded unless reward claiming functionality is added
2. **Reduced Protocol Revenue**
    - The protocol misses out on potential revenue streams from reward tokens
    - Lost opportunity for treasury diversification through reward tokens

**Recommended Mitigation:** To address this, consider implementing:

1. Integration with Aave's IncentivesController to enable reward claiming
2. A reward distribution system that fairly allocates claimed rewards between users and protocol
3. Regular automated claiming mechanisms to optimize reward collection

### Compromised trader account can block admin from revoking access

**Description:** The trading strategy contract for D2 defines two roles: `ADMIN_ROLE` and `EXECUTOR_ROLE`. The `EXECUTOR_ROLE` is intended for the active party responsible for executing trades on behalf of stakers, while the `ADMIN_ROLE` is a more passive role, primarily reserved for emergency interventions.

The issue arises in [`Vault::initialize`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/VaultV3.sol#L61-L81), where the `args.trader` [is assigned](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/VaultV3.sol#L71-L74) both `ADMIN_ROLE` and `EXECUTOR_ROLE`:
```solidity
s.grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, args._owner);
s.grantRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE, args._owner);
s.grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, args._trader); // @audit admin given to trader as well
s.grantRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE, args._trader);
```
This setup introduces a security risk: if the trader’s account is compromised, the attacker could revoke the owner’s admin privileges, preventing them from removing the compromised trader from the `EXECUTOR_ROLE`.

**Impact:** If the trader account is compromised, the protocol admin may be unable to revoke the `EXECUTOR_ROLE` from the attacker before they can exploit their access. This could result in unauthorized or malicious trades, potentially harming the protocol and its stakeholders.


**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider not assigning `ADMIN_ROLE` to `args.trader`:
```diff
  s.grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, args._owner);
  s.grantRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE, args._owner);
- s.grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, args._trader);
  s.grantRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE, args._trader);
```

### Improper deadline handling

**Description:** The Bera module shows improper handling of transaction deadlines in DEX operations:

- KodiakV2/V3 operations use `type(uint256).max` as deadline:

```solidity
// Bera.sol
function bera_kodiakv2_add(...) {
    kodiakv2.addLiquidity(..., type(uint256).max);
}

function bera_kodiakv2_swap(address token, uint amount, uint amountMin, address[] calldata path) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) nonReentrant {
    ...
    kodiakv2.swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
        ...
        type(uint256).max
    );
}

function bera_kodiakv3_increase(...) {
    kodiakv3.increaseLiquidity(IKodiakV3.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
        ...
        deadline: type(uint256).max
    }));
}
```

- OogaBooga and KodiakV3 (see issue _7.3.6 `Bera_Module::bera_kodiakv3_swap` broken due to `deadline` parameter_) swaps lack deadline protection entirely:

```solidity
function bera_oogabooga_swap(...) {
    oogaBooga.swap(tokenInfo, pathDefinition, executor, referralCode);
}
```

Using infinite deadlines or no deadlines at all is a risky practice in DeFi. Transaction deadlines are a crucial protection mechanism that prevents trades from executing under unexpected market conditions, especially during network congestion or high volatility periods.

**Impact:** While access is restricted to EXECUTOR_ROLE, improper deadline handling could lead to:

- Trades executing at unexpected times during network congestion
- No protection against stale transactions in volatile market conditions
- MEV bots could hold transactions and execute them at disadvantageous moments
- No mechanism to invalidate outdated trades

For OogaBooga specifically, the lack of deadline parameter in their protocol design leaves users exposed to these risks without any way to protect themselves.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
- For Kodiak operations, implement reasonable deadlines:

```solidity
uint256 private constant MAX_DEADLINE_WINDOW = 30 minutes;

function bera_kodiakv2_add(...) {
    kodiakv2.addLiquidity(..., block.timestamp + MAX_DEADLINE_WINDOW);
}
```

- For OogaBooga and Kodiak V3, consider implementing a wrapper that adds deadline protection:

```solidity
function bera_oogabooga_swap(..., uint256 deadline) {
   require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Expired");
    oogaBooga.swap(...);
}

function bera_kodiakv3_swap(..., uint256 deadline) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) nonReentrant {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Expired");
    ...
    kodiakv3swap.exactInput(IKodiakV3.ExactInputParams({
        ...
    }));
}
```

**D2:** Ignored "Improper deadline handling" because we mostly don't care about it on our main chain Arbitrum, although we understand how it's riskier for on Mainnet

**Cyfrin:** Acknowledged.


### Missing events for important state changes

**Description:** The following calls lack events emitted even though they change important states inside the contracts:
* `Strategy::claim`
* `Strategy::setFrozen`
* `Strategy::setSelector`
* `VaultV3::emergencyFreeze`


**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider adding events to be emitted in the above calls. This provides a clear on-chain record of when and by whom the strategy was claimed, improving transparency and auditability.


**D2:** Ignored "Missing events for important state changes" as we will remove those calls shortly

**Cyfrin:** Acknowledged.


### `Silo_Module::silo_execute` will revert as approval is to the wrong contract

**Description:** D2 integrates with the lending protocol [Silo](https://www.silo.finance/) via the [`Silo_Module`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Silo.sol), which facilitates communication with the Silo contract.

One of the functions in this module is [`Silo_Module::silo_execute`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Silo.sol#L55-L58), which allows bundling multiple calls and sending them to the Silo Router to optimize gas usage:

```solidity
function silo_execute(ISiloRouter.Action[] calldata actions) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) nonReentrant {
    // @audit approval should be to `address(router)` as it is the one facilitating the actions
    IERC20(actions[0].asset).approve(actions[0].silo, actions[0].amount);
    router.execute(actions);
}
```
The issue here is that the approval is incorrectly granted to `actions[0].silo`, whereas it should be granted to `router`, as this is the contract responsible for handling all token transfers.

**Impact:** The `silo_execute` function will fail due to the incorrect approval. While this does not affect the overall functionality of `Silo_Module`—since all necessary actions can still be executed separately—the gas savings intended by bundling transactions will be lost, leading to higher transaction costs.

**Proof of Concept:** The following test highlights the issue:
```solidity
function test_silo_execute() public {
    deal(WETH_ADDRESS,address(strategy),1e18);

    ISiloRouter.Action[] memory actions = new ISiloRouter.Action[](4);
    actions[0] = ISiloRouter.Action(ISiloRouter.ActionType.Deposit, GMX_SILO, WETH_ADDRESS, 1e18, false);
    actions[1] = ISiloRouter.Action(ISiloRouter.ActionType.Borrow, GMX_SILO, GMX_ADDRESS, 100e18, false);
    actions[2] = ISiloRouter.Action(ISiloRouter.ActionType.Repay, GMX_SILO, GMX_ADDRESS, 100e18, false);
    actions[3] = ISiloRouter.Action(ISiloRouter.ActionType.Withdraw, GMX_SILO, WETH_ADDRESS, 1e18-1, false);

    vm.prank(EXECUTOR);
    silo.silo_execute(actions);

    assertEq(gmxDebtToken.balanceOf(address(strategy)), 1);
    assertEq(gmxCollateralToken.balanceOf(address(strategy)), 0);
    assertEq(wethCollateralToken.balanceOf(address(strategy)), 0);
    assertEq(address(strategy).balance, 1e18-1);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider approving `router` instead:
```diff
- IERC20(actions[0].asset).approve(actions[0].silo, actions[0].amount);
+ IERC20(actions[0].asset).approve(address(router), actions[0].amount);
```

**D2:** Fixed in [`ea03f4d`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/commit/ea03f4d4b5baf1436a7c49e789a499b489713606)

### Silo and Dolomite lack LTV limit increasing liquidation risk

**Description:** When borrowing from Aave, there is a check in [`Aave_Module::aave_borrow`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Aave.sol#L51-L54) to ensure that the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio remains below `MAX_LTV_FACTOR` (80%):

```solidity
pool.borrow(asset, amount, interestRateMode, referralCode, onBehalfOf);
(uint256 totalCollateralBase, uint256 totalDebtBase, , , uint256 ltv, ) = pool.getUserAccountData(onBehalfOf);
uint256 maxDebtBase = (totalCollateralBase * ltv * MAX_LTV_FACTOR) / (BASIS_FACTOR * MANTISSA_FACTOR);
require(totalDebtBase <= maxDebtBase, "borrow amount exceeds max LTV");
```

However, this LTV check is missing from [`Silo_Module::silo_borrow`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Silo.sol#L44-L47) and [`Dolomite_Module::dolomite_openBorrowPosition`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Dolomite.sol#L208-L216)/[`dolomite_transferBetweenAccounts`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Dolomite.sol#L226-L234), which are also lending protocols. As a result, positions with a higher LTV than 80% can be opened in these platforms.

**Impact:** Since Silo and Dolomite do not enforce the same 80% LTV limit higher risk positions can be entered. This increases the likelihood of unexpected liquidations, exposing users to unnecessary financial risk.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider implementing the same LTV checks for Silo and Dolomite.

**D2:** Ignored "Silo and Dolomite lack LTV limit increasing liquidation risk", will assume the trader is not reckless

**Cyfrin:** Acknowledged.


### Borrowing non-approved tokens can bypass trading restrictions

**Description:** In the `Inch_Module` swap functions, the output token is verified to ensure it is approved by the protocol. This validation helps maintain trust that only pre-approved tokens will be traded.

However, the trader can still borrow non-approved tokens, bypassing this restriction. This undermines the assumption that only approved tokens can be used or held by the Strategy contract.

**Impact:** The expectation that only approved tokens will be used in trading can be violated if a trader borrows and holds non-approved tokens. This weakens the protocol’s asset control and may introduce unforeseen risks.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider validating that the borrowed tokens in Aave, Silo and Dolomite are also approved tokens.


**D2:** Fixed for Aave and Silo in [`1704b31`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/commit/1704b315b576175932abf11ff50252007cc2d702), Dolomite acknowledged.

**Description:** The following calls have no corresponding call on the Dolomite [deployed contract](https://berascan.com/address/0xd6a31b6aea4d26a19bf479b5032d9ddc481187e6#writeContract):
* [`Dolomite_Module::dolomite_depositETH`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Dolomite.sol#L127-L131)

### Unnecessary validation in `Bera_Module::bera_infrared_stake` should follow standard pattern

**Description:** In [`Bera_Module::bera_infrared_stake`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Bera.sol#L78-L82), there is a call to `validateToken(vault)`:

```solidity
function bera_infrared_stake(address vault, address token, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) nonReentrant {
    validateToken(vault); // @audit unnecessary
    IERC20(token).approve(vault, amount);
    IInfraredVault(vault).stake(amount);
}
```

This is unusual because the validation is applied to `vault` rather than `token`. Additionally, the check is unnecessary since the `token` must already be present in the contract, and for that to happen, it must be included in `allowedTokens`.

However, the `validateToken(vault)` function does serve a purpose—it prevents the trader from using a malicious `vault` contract. Therefore, the target should still be validated, but using a more appropriate approach. This pattern is already established in other parts of the codebase, where the validation is performed inside the [`TraderV0::approve`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Trader.sol#L1958-L1963) function. To maintain consistency, we suggest following the same approach here.

Consider removing both the `validateToken(vault);` call and the approval altogether:

```diff
function bera_infrared_stake(address vault, address token, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) nonReentrant {
-   validateToken(vault);
-   IERC20(token).approve(vault, amount);
    IInfraredVault(vault).stake(amount);
}
```

### Unused imports

**Description:** There are a couple of unused imports in the contracts:

```solidity
import "@solidstate/contracts/introspection/ERC165/base/ERC165Base.sol";
import "@solidstate/contracts/proxy/diamond/writable/DiamondWritableInternal.sol";
```

These are imported in:
* [`Dolomite.sol#L6-L7`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Dolomite.sol#L6-L7)

### Aave `swapBorrowRateMode` is deprecated

**Description:** In the `Aave_Module` there is a call [`aave_swapBorrowRateMode`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/blob/c2fc257605ebc725525028a5c17f30c74202010b/contracts/modules/Aave.sol#L67-L69):

### Selectors for `Bera_Module::bera_kodiakv2_swap` and `bera_kodiakv3_swap` needs to be separately added

**Description:** In `Strategy::constructor` almost all existing facet selectors are added to the `s.selectors` mapping, which is then used by the fallback function to direct the call to the correct facet.

Almost all, the `Bera_Module::bera_kodiakv2_swap` and `bera_kodiakv3_swap` are not present here and need to be added separately using the `Strategy::setSelector` call limited to role `0x00` (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`).

Consider including these in the general selector assignment in `Strategy::constructor` instead. Thus saving two calls.


**D2:** Added in [`5e22afc`](https://github.com/d2sd2s/d2-contracts/commit/5e22afc1995cf93930ddb738b9e9427846f14515)

### Consider using Ownable2Step instead of Ownable

**Description:** The `VaultV3` and `VaultV0` contracts use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` for access control. While secure, this single-step ownership transfer pattern risks permanently locking the contracts if ownership is accidentally transferred to an invalid or inaccessible address.

Consider using `Ownable2Step` instead, which requires the new owner to accept ownership in a separate transaction. This two-step pattern is considered best practice as it prevents accidental transfers and ensures the new owner can actually interact with the contract.

**D2:** Ignored "Consider using Ownable2Step instead of Ownable" we'll consider it for the future

**Cyfrin:** Acknowledged.
