# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Incorrect Access Control via Malicious `CosmWasm` Contract

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

The system is vulnerable to incorrect access control through the deployment and use of a malicious CosmWasm contract via IBC interactions.

**Impact:** 

This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, loss of funds, or unexpected minting of tokens.

**Likelihood:** 

Low to moderate, as it requires the ability to deploy and execute malicious contracts.

**Recommendation**: 

Upgrade github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v7/modules/core/keeper to version 7.4.0 or higher to address this vulnerability.

### IClear Text Logging of Sensitive Credentials (client/export.go)

**Severity:** Medium

**Status:** Acknowledged

**Impact:** 

Unsanitized input from sensitive credentials is logged in clear text, potentially exposing private keys.

**Likelihood:** 

Moderate, as malicious actors could access this information with access to the logs.

**Recommendation:** 

Sanitize or hash sensitive information before logging. Consider using a secure logging mechanism that encrypts or obscures sensitive data.

**Code Snippet:**

export.go:80 `keyS := strings.ToUpper(hexutil.Encode(privB)[2:])`
export.go:82 `fmt.Println(keyS)`



### DoS in CometBFT Block Sync (github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blocksync)


**Severity:** Medium

**Status:** Acknowledged

**Description:** 

A malicious peer can cause a DoS by sending a block with a very high LastCommit round, leading to excessive memory usage and potential crashes.

**Impact:** 

This vulnerability can disrupt the normal operation of the Shido blockchain by preventing it from syncing with the network.

**Likelihood:** 

Low to moderate, as it requires a malicious peer with knowledge of the block sync mechanism.

**Recommendation:** Upgrade github.com/cometbft/cometbft to the latest version to mitigate this issue.

### DoS in Cosmos SDK Crisis Module (github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/crisis)


**Severity:** Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description:** 

The chain does not halt when an invariant check fails on a Cosmos SDK network, and a transaction is sent to the x/crisis module.

**Impact**: 

This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, in which an attacker repeatedly triggers invariant failures to disrupt the network.

**Likelihood:** 

Moderate, as it requires knowledge of the invariant checks and the ability to craft malicious transactions.

**Recommendation:** 

There is no fixed version for github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/crisis. Consider implementing a custom solution to handle invariant failures gracefully, such as logging the error, notifying administrators, and potentially pausing block production until the issue is resolved.

### Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in go-jose (github.com/dvsekhvalnov/jose2go)


**Severity:** Medium

**Status:** Acknowledged

**Description:** 

The library is vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption due to improper input validation, which could lead to excessive memory or CPU usage.

**Impact:** 

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**Likelihood:** 

Low, as it requires the ability to send specially crafted requests to the application.

**Recommendation:** 

Upgrade github.com/dvsekhvalnov/jose2go to the latest version to mitigate this issue.

### Consensus Issues in go-ethereum (github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)


**Severity:** Medium

**Status:** Acknowledged

**Description:** 

Several vulnerabilities related to consensus mechanisms in go-ethereum were identified, including:

- Integer overflow in the Ethash consensus engine (CVE-2021-42219, CWE-400O)
- Potential for state inconsistency in certain consensus scenarios (CVE-2020-26240, CWE-682)
  
**Impact:** 

These vulnerabilities could lead to forks in the blockchain or other consensus-related issues.

**Likelihood:** Low to moderate, as they often require specific conditions or complex attacks to exploit.

**Recommendation:** 

Upgrade github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum to the latest version, which includes fixes for these consensus-related vulnerabilities.

## Low Risk

### GoBoolExpressions


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description:** 

The codebase contains multiple instances of boolean expressions that are always true or false. These do not pose a security risk but can impact code readability and maintainability.

**Files:**

x/evm/types/params.go: 69
x/evm/types/params.go: 70
x/evm/types/params.go: 73
x/feemarket/migrations/v4/types/params.go: 79
x/feemarket/types/params.go: 77

**Recommendation:** 

Review and simplify these expressions where possible. For example, in app/ante/cosmos/setup_test.go, the expression checkTx is always false. This could be simplified by removing the conditional check or setting checkTx to true if needed.

### GoDeprecation


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description:** 

The codebase uses several deprecated functions and types. While this does not necessarily indicate a vulnerability, it is good practice to update to newer versions to benefit from potential improvements and bug fixes.

**Files**: 

Multiple files throughout the codebase.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the codebase to use the latest versions of libraries and frameworks. Specifically, deprecated functions like EmitEvents and EmitEvent should be replaced with their recommended alternatives. For example, in app/ante/cosmos/fees.go, app/ante/evm/eth.go, and other files, replace ctx.EventManager().EmitEvents(events) with ctx.EventManager().EmitTypedEvent(&events).

### GoDfaConstantCondition


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

Some conditional checks are always true or false due to constant values. This can be simplified to improve code readability.

**Files**:

app/app.go: 1239
precompiles/vesting/events.go: 53
rpc/websockets.go: 477
x/wasm/ibctesting/chain.go: 562

**Recommendation**: 

Remove or refactor these unnecessary conditional checks. For example, in app/app.go:1239, the condition if storeUpgrades != nil is always false and can be removed.

### GoDfaErrorMayBeNotNil


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description:** 

There are instances where errors are not explicitly checked after function calls, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

**Files**:
crypto/hd/utils_test.go: 147
ethereum/eip712/eip712.go: 14
testutil/tx/eip712.go: 61
x/wasm/keeper/querier_test.go: 854

**Recommendation**: 

Add error checks after these function calls and handle the errors appropriately (e.g., log the error, return an error, or take corrective action). For example, in crypto/hd/utils_test.go:147, add a check for err != nil after privateKey.ToECDSA()

### GoDfaNilDereference


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description:** 

Some method calls could dereference nil pointers, leading to runtime errors.

**Files:**

rpc/backend/chain_info.go: 208
rpc/backend/node_info.go: 95
x/wasm/keeper/keeper_test.go: 706, 987
x/wasm/module_test.go: 581

**Recommendation**: 

Add nil checks for the variables (e.g., err) before calling methods on them (e.g., err.Error()). For example, in rpc/backend/chain_info.go:208, add a check like if err != nil { ... } before logging err.Error().

### GoExportedFuncWithUnexportedType


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description:** 

Some exported functions return unexported types, which can make it difficult for external packages to use them.

**Files**:

x/wasm/ibc_integration_test.go: 232
x/wasm/relay_pingpong_test.go: 332

**Recommendation**: 

Either export the relevant types (captureAckTestContractEngine and hit) or refactor the code to return values of exported types. This would improve the usability of these functions for external packages.

### GoImportUsedAsName
