# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Centralization issues in `ParibusOracleDelegate`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The `_setCollectionWhitelisted()` function can be used by an owner to add or remove an NFT collection from whitelist anytime. This can lead to a malicious admin unfairly removing any NFT collection from the whitelist anytime. 

Also `_setUpdater()` function can be used anytime by an admin to change the updater of the contract. This can have a strong impact on the contract as `setCollectionPricesWei()` and `setPricesWei()` can be called by an updater. And changing an updater to a compromised address can lead to `setCollectionPricesWei()` and `setPricesWei()` being exploited and set to unfair values.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to use multisig wallets for the ownership of the contract, to allow more decentralization and prevent loss of private keys or malicious behaviours. Additionally it is advised to use a 3/5 or 2/3 configuration for the multisig wallets being used.

**Comments**: The team said that they will be considering adding more decentralization in future.

## Low Risk

### For loop over Dynamic Array

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description** 

In ParibusOracleDelegate.sol, there is for loop over dynamic array in `_setCollectionWhitelisted()` function on line: 32 as follows: 
```solidity
       for (uint i = 0; i < nfts.length; i++) {
           collectionWhitelist[nfts[i]] = whitelisted;
       }
```
Similarly, there is for loop over dynamic array on line: 62 in `setCollectionPricesWei()` function:
```solidity
       for (uint i = 0; i < dataLen; i++) {
           TokenPrice storage tokenPrice = collectionPrices[tokenIds[i]];
           tokenPrice.priceWei = pricesWei[i];
           tokenPrice.updatedAt = getBlockTimestamp();
       }
```
And there is for loop over dynamic array on line: 73 in `setPricesWei()` function:
```solidity
     for (uint i = 0; i < dataLen; i++) {
           TokenPrice storage tokenPrice = tokenPrices[nfts[i]][tokenIds[i]];
           tokenPrice.priceWei = pricesWei[i];
           tokenPrice.updatedAt = getBlockTimestamp();
       }
```
This can lead to out of gas issues if length if the array being passed is too large.

**Recommendation**: 

Although `onlyOwner` access control modifier has been used which prevents DDoS as well as access control issues, it is advised to keep a keen eye on the length of the array being passed so that the loop does not run out of gas while calling the these functions. Additionally, it is advised to use a max length check in order to mitigate this issue.

### Missing sanity value checks

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description** 


In `ParibusOracleDelegate.sol`, there is missing sanity value checks for pricesWei calldata array parameter for both `setCollectionPricesWei()` and `setPricesWei()` functions. This can lead to incorrect values such as 0 value being assigned.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add sanity value checks for such as non-zero value checks, max value checks, etc. for values of pricesWei array, before being assigned to `tokenPrice.priceWei`. 

## Informational

### Solidity naming conventions not followed

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

In `ParibusOracleDelegator.sol`, the solidity naming conventions have not been followed for naming the function `_setImplementation()`. The underscore should be used for naming only internal functions in Solidity. But `_setImplementation()` is a public function and not an internal function.
Similarly, in the `ParibusOracleDelegate.sol` the naming convention has again been not followed. The function `_setUpdater()` uses an underscore even though it is not an internal function.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to rename the functions according to the Solidity naming conventions for better code readability and remove the underscore from the names of-
`_setImplementation()` in `ParibusOracleDelegator.sol` and
`_setUpdater()` in `ParibusOracleDelegate.sol`
