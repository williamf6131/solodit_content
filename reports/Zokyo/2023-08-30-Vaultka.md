# Findings

## High Risk

### An Attacker Can Make Victim's Deposit Be Locked Forever

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

Inside the deposit() function in Water.sol let's consider the following scenario ->

1.) Victim deposits x amount of assets into the Water contract, expecting good returns. He can withdraw at block.timestamp + lockTime

2.) It's almost time to withdraw for the victim, now an attacker calls deposit() with `assets` as 1 (1 USDC) and the receiver as a victim.

3.) The `userTimelock` for the victim gets reset again to block.timestamp + lockTime.

If this griefing keeps happening, the victim won't be able to withdraw ever (Due to check at L209)

**Recommendation** 

The functionality to deposit for others should be removed.

**Comment**: The new fix adds another critical bug where a user can deposit to another account and instantly remove the funds bypassing the lockup.

**Comment**: The client fixed the following issue in commit: 7d32cf53cebcb6c81bc4755bbfd6befe4ac8522b. However, the paremter `address _receiver` should be removed as it has no functionality. 

### Water deposit is exposed to inflation attack

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Water.sol - The ERC4626 version used is exposed to inflation attack. That leads to having function deposit() in the water contract to be exploited by attackers to achieve illegitimate gains. The description of the attack scenario as well as the mitigation is described: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc4626.

**Recommendation** 

Follow the mitigation suggested in the link.
 

## Medium Risk

### No slippage protection

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

SakeVaultV2.sol - In function _swap() which is invoked by external functions: openPosition() and fulfilledRequestSwap(). As _swap() interacts with an external Decentralized Exchange (DEX), it can be exposed to price slippage on execution. The functions mentioned do not consider requiring the output amount to be greater than the desired minimum amount.
For instance, velaShares is the output amount received of vlp after staking USDC that resulted from _swap. velaShares can end up being less than the desirable amount that the user had in mind at the beginning of the execution of openPosition(). The same should be considered in fulfilledRequestSwap().

**Recommendation** 

Add an argument in openPosition() and fulfilledRequestSwap() that represents the desirable output amount to be set by the user. 
Fix: Client acknowledges that slippage amount of swap is to be handled via Kyberswap by passing information about it through the calldata. 
 

### Centralization Risk

**Severity** : Medium

**Status** : Acknowledged 

**Description**

The whole system grants too much power to the owner, for example - inside the SakeVault.sol the owner can call `withdrawAllESVELA` to withdraw all the esVELA to the feeReceiver which can be set to the owner himself using the changeProtocolFee function. The owner has the privilege to all the critical functionalities and can be manipulated in a 
way that harms the protocol (Another example can be setting MAX_LEVERAGE and MIN_LEVERAGE to arbitrary amounts, adding weird - ERC20 tokens into the whitelist of tokens which can have unintended behavior in the ERC4626 vault if a token is said a fee on transfer).

**Recommendation** 

Ensure the owner is a multisig and add suitable checks wherever necessary, even on functions with onlyOwner.


### Users Might Receive Undesired Tokens In fullfilledRequestSwap

**Severity** : Medium

**Status** : Resolved 

**Description**

Say a user closed his position (closePosition() in SakeVaultV2.sol) and does not want to withdraw in USDC. 
`closePositionAmount[_user][_positionID] = amountAfterFee;` and `closePositionRequest[_user][_positionID] = true;` would be set in this case.
Now imagine, me as an attacker call `fulfilledRequestSwap` at L744 but with `_outputAsset` as a token which is pretty volatile or in extreme conditions a meme coin, whereas the user wanted to swap to a more stable coin (all whitelisted).

The user gets his withdraw amount in an asset which might lose value quickly and is highly intended.

**Recommendation** 

Ensure this check on the function ->
```solidity
UserInfo storage _userInfo = userInfo[_user][_positionID];
require(msg.sender == _userInfo.user)
```

**Comment**: Client fixed the following issue in commit: 7d32cf53cebcb6c81bc4755bbfd6befe4ac8522b


## Low Risk

### Return Value Of repayDebt Not Checked

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description**

The function repayDebt inside Water.sol at L153 returns a bool indicating the success of the debt repayment operation. 
This function is used inside SakeVaultV2.sol at L698 where the return value of this call is not checked.
Due to this, the call might fail silently and a return would happen at the next line.
This means that when closing a position (fully closing) if DTV goes beyond the liquidation threshold, a user won't actually be liquidated (if the repaydebt call fails) and the function executes normally.
Similar to L708 , where the call might fail and the debt won't be repaid to the Water contract, and the rest of the function executes normally.

**Recommendation** 

Add a check `require(success)` after a repayDebt call like `(bool success) = IWater(water).repayDebt()`
 

### openPosition exposed to cross-function reentrance

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

SakeVaultV2.sol - Function openPosition() is not guarded by nonReentrant modifier which makes it susceptible to be reentered from other related functions like closePosition(). Functions like openPosition(), closePosition(), liquidatePosition(), fulfulliedRequestSwap() involve related asset transfers with updating related mappings of contract state. Hence, it is required that they are all guarded by a reentrance guard.

**Recommendation**  

Add nonReentrant modifier to openPosition to prevent the function from being reentered from the other mentioned functions.


### Cooldown Period Is 48-72 hours In Docs But 24 hours In Code

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description**

Inside the docs the cooldown period is mentioned to be 48-72 hours, but in the code (Water.sol at L62) it is initialized to 24 hours.
The logic should match the intended usage, furthermore the code mention "The execution frequency will be improved in SAKE v2 to further shorten the cooldown to exactly 48 hours"

**Recommendation** 

The value for lock time should be initialized according to the docs/intention.

### Uninitialized reentrance guard

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

SakeVaultV2.sol - In function initialize() the initializer of ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable (i.e. __ReentrancyGuard_init() ) is not invoked. This is a bug because the default value of _status is 0 while the initializer sets it to 1. The severity of the issue is limited though because once the modifier nonReentrant is used once the value of _status becomes the proper expected value.

**Recommendation** 

Invoke __ReentrancyGuard_init() in body of initialize().

## Informational

### Users Will Be Forced To Liquidations Due To Missing Functionality To Update Position

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

A user can create a new position using the function `openPosition()` inside SakeVaultV2.sol at L564. 
As the DTV for the user's position comes close to the liquidation threshold, the user can do nothing to prevent the liquidation, since there is no mechanism to update a user's position or a repay mechanism. The only functionalities available are openPosition , closePosition, and liquidatePosition.

**Recommendation**

Introduce a function where the user specifies his position ( from the userInfo mapping) and the function updates the position with the given parameters.

**Comment from a client** 

This feature may not be common when applying to tradfi, but we believe it does not pose any risk to users. Users can always close their position and prevent liquidation.

### closePositionRequest value not updated on request fulfillment

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

SakeVaultV2.sol - In fulfilledRequestSwap(), we have the mapping closePositionRequest is not updated for the user. The mapping is expected to be true in order here:
require(closePositionRequest[_user][_positionID], "SAKE: Close only open position");
It is expected to be reassigned to false after that, which signifies that the user does not have a claimable amount of asset to be swapped and withdrawn. The severity of the issue is limited though by having closePositionAmount[_user][_positionID] assigned to zero.`

**Recommendation** 

Update the value of closePositionRequest[_user][_positionID].

### Events not emitted on calling critical functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**:  Acknowledged 
```solidity
function setAssetWhitelist(address _asset, bool _status) public onlyOwner 
function setFeeSplit(uint256 _feeSplit) public onlyOwner 


function setUtilRate(uint256 _utilRate) public onlyOwner 
```
SakeVaultV2.sol/Water.sol - No events emitted on changing significant parameters of the contracts by admin and assets transfers.

**Recommendation** 

Emit an event in the body of the admin functions.

**Fix**:  

Issue is partially fixed in commit 9b0f573 but functions that cause asset transfer like withdrawVesting, claim, withdrawAllVELA, withdrawAllESVELA are not addressed as well as setUtilRate which is in Water.sol . 

**Fix**: 

As of commit a7edc1e, client added UtilRateChanged event to be emitted on calling setUtilRate. Other functions are unchanged though acknowledged by client.

### Misleading revert message

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Invalid

SakeVaultV2.sol - Function setFeeSplit() shows a misleading revert message:
require(_feeSplit <= 90, "Fee split cannot be more than 100%");

**Recommendation** 

To be replaced by "Fee split cannot be more than 90%"


### Comment mismatch

**Severity** : Informational

**Status** : Resolved

**Description**

The comment at L388 should be at L385 and vice versa in SakeVaultV2.sol.

**Recommendation** 

Swap the comments.

### Lower and upper bounds of the new withdrawal fees are not validated

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

SakeVaultV2.sol - In function changeProtocolFee, the argument newWithdrawalFee should be within certain determined bounds. In the body of the function the newWithdrawalFee is not being validated to be a proper input to be the new value of feeConfiguration.withdrawalFee.
```solidity
function changeProtocolFee(address newFeeReceiver, uint256 newWithdrawalFee) external onlyOwner {
    feeConfiguration.withdrawalFee = newWithdrawalFee;
    feeConfiguration.feeReceiver = newFeeReceiver;
    emit ProtocolFeeChanged(newFeeReceiver, newWithdrawalFee);
}
```
**Recommendation** 

Add require statement to validate the newWithdrawalFee to be a proper value. Also, check newFeeReceiver to assert that it is a non-zero address.
Fix: In commit 9b0f573, function name has changed to setProtocolFee.  Address input is validated to be non-zero address, but numerical uint values are not validated despite expected to be within a certain range. 

### Misleading comments

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

SakeVaultV2.sol - In function getUpdatedDebtAndValue(): comments in lines 385 and 388 do not reflect the conditions in the if branches that they belong to.
```solidity
378     if (currentPosition > previousValueInUSDC) {
379         profitOrLoss = currentPosition - previousValueInUSDC;
380         // Call the `profitSplit` function to calculate the reward split to water and the amount owed to water
381         (rewardSplitToWater, ) = profitSplit(profitOrLoss);
382         // The amount owed to water is the user's leverage amount plus the reward split to water
383         owedToWater = leverage + rewardSplitToWater;
384     } else if (previousValueInUSDC > currentPosition) {
385         // If the current position and previous value are the same, the amount owed to water is just the leverage amount
386         owedToWater = leverage;
387     } else {
388         // If the current position is less than the previous value, the amount owed to water is the leverage amount
389         owedToWater = leverage;
390     }
```
**Recommendation** 

Swap the mentioned comments.


### Typos

**Severity** : Informational

**Status** : Acknowledged  

**Description**

The revert string for require at L109 inside SakeVaultV2 should be "Sake: positionID is not valid.

The revert string for require at L207 inside SakeVaultV2 should be "Fee split cannot be more than 90%" instead.


### Missing Documentation

**Severity** : Information

**Status** : Acknowledged 

**Description**

The contract SakeVaultV2 lacks documentation for all the state variables plus functions like claim etc. Proper natspec documentation is necessary to increase readability and increase the overall quality of the codebase.

### Floating pragma

**Severity** : Informational

**Status** : Acknowledged  

**Description**

The solidity version is not locked throughout the codebase if a version of solidity has a bug that might propagate. Always ensure to test and write contracts at a fixed solidity version.

**Recommendation** 

Ensure the solidity version is fixed.

### Structs Can Be Packed Together To Save A Lot Of Gas

**Severity** : Informational

**Status** : Acknowledged 

**Description**

Inside the UserInfo struct in SakeVaultV2 , if we declare the `bool liquidated` just below the `address user` that will save
one storage slot saving ~20000 gas. 

In FeeConfiguration struct `withdrawalFee` can be made into a uint128 ad that will result in one less storage slot.

Inside struct Datas , `profits` can be easily converted to uint128 as it is ample for accounting profits, and then `profits` and  `inFull` can be clubbed together inside the same slot to save one storage slot.


### No information returned about the new positionId created

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged 

SakeVaultV2.sol - In openPosition(), a new position is created, but the value of the id about that position is missing.

**Recommendation** 

Return its value or emit it in an event.
