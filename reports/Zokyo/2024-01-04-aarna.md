## High Risk

### Unintended tokens proportion reset in `applySwapsAndPassiveRebal` function

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The `applySwapsAndPassiveRebal` function, which is called in the deposit function of AFiBase contract, depending on certain conditions, invokes the applyRebalForProportions function in the AFiPassiveRebalanceStrategies contract. The problem arises when the strategy number is anything other than 1, leading to the return of an empty array. This could potentially reset the token proportions in the AFiBase contract, which can have unintended consequences on the functioning of the protocol.

The function applySwapsAndPassiveRebal checks if the strategy number is equal to or above 1.

If this condition is satisfied, it calls applyRebalForProportions function.
```solidity
   if (
     typeOfProduct == 2 &&
     isPassiveRebalEnabled &&
     (block.timestamp - lastRebalTime >= rebalPeriod) &&
     strategy >= 1
   ) {
     uTokenProportions = rebalContract.applyRebalForProportions(
       address(this),
       aFiManager,
       address(aFiStorage),
       strategy,
       uTokens
     );
```
Within applyRebalForProportions, an uninitialized array uTokenProportions is created. If the strategy number passed is 1, uTokenProportions is updated. However, for any other number (e.g., 2), it remains empty and is subsequently returned.
```solidity
uint[] memory uTokenProportions = new uint[](_tokens.length);
   if (_strategyNumber == 1) {
     uTokenProportions =  IAFiManager(_aFiManager).updateUTokenProportion(_aFiContract, _aFiStorage);
   }
   return uTokenProportions;
```
This will lead to unintended behaviors when trying to perform swaps, rebalances, or any other operations that rely on token proportions.

**Recommendation**: Update the uTokenProportions only when the strategy number is 1.

**Fix**: The vulnerability has been fixed as recommended.


### Potential asset under-disbursement in withdraw function of AFiBase contract

**Severity**: High

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The withdrawal function in the AFiBase contract is designed to allow users to redeem their shares for the corresponding assets. The function computes the user's entitled assets based on their share in the pool. Then, the swapForOtherProduct function is invoked to calculate and prepare the assets for withdrawal. Before transferring the funds to user, the contract checks if it has enough of oToken to satisfy the computed amount r:
```solidity
   if (IERC20(oToken).balanceOf(address(this)) >= redFromContract) {
     IERC20(oToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, redFromContract);
   } else {
     IERC20(oToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, IERC20(oToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
   }
```
If the contract does not have enough oToken, users will receive less than they are supposed to, based on their share calculation. This is especially concerning if the contract's balance is significantly lower than r.

**Recommendation**: 

Before allowing a withdrawal, the contract should check if it can satisfy the user's entitlement. If funds are insufficient, the transaction should be reverted or the contract logs the remaining owed amount, ensuring the user can retrieve their due sum when sufficient funds are available.

**Fix**: Issue fixed. If the available funds are insufficient, the transaction reverts.



### The 10 seconds duration for TWAP calculation is too small 

**Severity**: High

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The `estimateAmountOutMin` function from AFiOracle contract uses a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) derived from a 10-second observation window to estimate output amounts for token swaps. Given that the average block time on the Ethereum network is approximately 12 seconds, TWAP with that short duration can be easily influenced by the trades within a single block. 

**Recommendation**: 

Increase a TWAP observation window to at least 900 seconds.

**Fix**: The TWAP observation has been updated to 900 seconds.

### Misleading slippage calculation

**Severity**: High

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The uniswapV3Router function from AFiBase contract is intended to calculate and use the minimumAmountOut to set a floor on the acceptable amount of output tokens the caller will receive from a Uniswap swap, as a protection against slippage. However, due to the logic within the function, the minimumAmountOut is effectively always set to 10 if initially calculated to be equal to or greater than 10
```solidity
   //safe calculation
   if (minimumAmountOut >= 10) {
     minimumAmountOut -= (minimumAmountOut - 10);
   }
```
The actual purpose of the minimumAmountOut is to protect users from unfavorable market shifts by ensuring that they get at least the minimum expected amount from their swap. By effectively setting this minimum to a static value of 10, the protection becomes essentially meaningless.

**Recommendation**: 

Distinguish between long-tail assets and relatively stable ones and adjust the SLIPPAGE_FACTOR accordingly.

**Fix**: 

The issue has been fixed as recommended.

### Update proportion not handling properly when totalProportion > 100%

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiManager.sol, the method updateProportion(...) is handling the case when totalProportion > 100% as follows:
```solidity
// fail safe condition
if(totalProp > 10000000){ 
uint256 rem = totalProp - 10000000;
if(_uTokenProportions[uTokenLen - 1] > rem){
_uTokenProportions[uTokenLen - 1] -= rem;
}
}
```
In this case, there can be situations where this fix will fail:

1. If the last proportion is not more than remainder: The total proportion will be more than 100% and this will impact the whole protocol

2. If the last proportion is exactly equal to the remainder: The last uToken will have 0 proportion which is considered as inactive while in rearrange() method and will not be stake even if token is present in the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to handle this scenario which ensures that the final total proportion is 100% and non-zero for all the uTokens.

**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.

## Medium Risk

### Fixed fee level used for Uniswap swaps

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The UniswapV3Router function from AFiBase contract utilizes the UniswapV3 swap feature, where it intends to swap tokens using a hardcoded fee level of 3000, equivalent to a fee rate of 0.3%. UniswapV3 introduced multiple fee levels to cater to different types of pools and trading behaviors. Not all pools in Uniswap v3 are created with the 0.3% fee rate. Additionally, even if a 0.3% fee pool exists for a pair, it might not necessarily be the most liquid or the optimal pool for the trade. Relying solely on a hardcoded fee level can lead to inefficiencies and potential failures in the swap operation.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a mechanism to dynamically identify the most optimal fee level for the swap. 

**Fix**: The protocol will use the fee of a pool previously accepted by the owner.



### Chainlink’s latestRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

 **Description**
 
The checkIfUSDC function in the AFiStorage contract retrieves price data from a Chainlink oracle by calling latestRoundData. However, there's a risk that this data may be stale or incorrect due to various reasons related to Chainlink oracles. There is no check if the return value indicates stale data. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:
https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds


**Recommendation**: 

Check the updatedAt parameter returned from latestRoundData() and compare it to a staleness threshold. Consider introducing a mapping for tracking heartbeat intervals for each allowlisted token. 

**Fix**: Recommended checks have been added in the getPriceAndDecimals function.

### Inconsistent fee deduction for fee-on-transfer tokens

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

The deposit function of the AFiBase contract is designed to allow users to deposit tokens into the contract. After initiating a deposit, a protocol fee is taken from the deposited amount. The design assumes that the entire amount specified by the user will be transferred to the contract. However, the protocol intends to handle a wide range of tokens and this assumption may not hold for all types, particularly fee-on-transfer tokens. 
Users depositing fee-on-transfer tokens end up being charged more than they might expect. They lose a bit of their deposit to the token's transfer fee and then get charged again on the original amount by the platform.

**Recommendation**: 

The contract should verify the actual amount of tokens received after the transfer. This can be done by checking the contract's balance of the respective token before and after the transfer operation.

**Acknowledge**: 

The protocol will not be using fee-on-transfer tokens.

### Pool address can be address(0) and revert due to the same

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiStorage.sol, method getMinimumAmount(...) has the following check:
```solidity
else if(_tokenIn == (midTok) || _tokenOut == (midTok)){
address pool = IAFi(afiContract).getPool(_tokenIn, midTok); 
amountOut = IUniswapOracleV3(uniswapOracleV3).estimateAmountOutMin(
_tokenIn,
uint128(_amountIn),
midTok,
pool
);
}else {
```
Here, if tokenIn == midTok, the getPool will return address(0) as both of the addresses are the same here. This will revert to an error with the message “pool doesn't exist”.

If tokenIn == midTok, then the final swap will be tokenIn == midTok -> tokenOut. In this case, getPool(midTok, tokenOut) should be used.

If tokenOut == midTok, then the final swap will be tokenIn -> midTok == tokenOut. In this case, getPool(tokenIn, midTok) should be used.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the above `if`  block to get the pool for the correct pair of tokens.

**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.



### Centralization risk due to owner setting the protocol contracts

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiStorage.sol, the owner can set the protocol contracts for aave, compound and dydx using afiSync(...) method.

A malicious owner can utilize this to set malicious address for the protocol contracts where eventually users funds will be staked. This might be detrimental to the users such as the lenders
As they will lose their deposited fund.

**Recommendation**:  

It is advised to utilize at least a 2/3 or a 3/5 Multisig wallet used by different trusted participants or use a secure governance mechanism to decentralize its usage.
**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.


### Comparison used in a wrong direction

**Severity**: Medium


**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


In the stakeShares function of the AFiBase contract, the greaterComparison function ensures that the amount to be unlocked is greater than or equal to the total value of the user's locked tokens. Subsequently, the desired value is subtracted from the total locked value. Because of the mentioned comparison, the current implementation permits unlocking only the entire balance.

**Recommendation**:

Switch the positions of the arguments provided to the greaterComparison function.

## Low Risk

### Use of single step ownership transfer

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The AFiFactory contract uses the Ownable contract which allows changing the owner address. If the admin’s address is set incorrectly, this could potentially result in critical functionalities becoming locked.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider implementing a two-step pattern. Utilize OpenZeppelin's Ownable2Step contract.



### AFiBase contracts can never be inactive once activated

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiStorage.sol, the mapping isAFIActive can only be set true for any aFiBase contract. Since this can be set false once activated, all the `require statements`  checking if any aFiBase contract is active or not will become obsolete as aFiBase contract will always be active.

These are following method which depend on this check:
```solidity
updateRebalanceDetails(...)
addTeamWallet(...)
deactivateTeamWallet(...)
reactivateTeamWallet(...)
```

**Recommendation**: 

Allow setAFiActive to set false for aFiBase contract as well.

**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.

### `calcPoolValue` and `calcPoolValueSome` are exactly the same

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiStorage, methods calcPoolValue(...) and calPoolValueSome(...) are implemented the same way with the same logic. 
One method should be enough to execute the logic externally and internally as well.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the contract to either remove or merge the above mentioned methods.
Fix: The issue has been fixed as recommended.


### Method `getPricePerFullShare` returns incorrect value

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiStorage, the method `getPricePerFullShare(...)` returns a value of 10000 when the total supply is 0. It is expected to be 1e6 instead of 10000 as the initial share price set for any aToken is 100 USDC.

Additionally, the return statement does not return value in 1e6 as well.
```solidity
return _pool.mul(100).div(_totalSupply);
```
For eg: After first deposit of 100 USDC worth tokens, the values are 
_pool = 100 * 1e18 and  _totalSupply = 1e18

Here pricePerFullShare = ((100 * 1e18)*(100))/(1e18) = 100*100 = 10000 but current price per share is 100 USDC so return should be 100*1e6. 



Also, the following check should be above the for loop:
```solidity
if(_totalSupply == 0){ 
return 1e6; 
}
```

**Recommendation**: 

Update the method to return in 1e6 when the total supply >= 0.

**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.

### `UpdateProfitShare` allows owner to set profit share to 100%

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiManager.sol, the method `updateProfitShare(...)` allows the owner to consume all of the profit made by the user during withdrawal. 

The documentation states a maximum of 10% but it is allowed up to 100% which clearly makes user profit as 0%.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the method updateProfitShare(...) to limit the totalProfit to 10%.
**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.


### Lack of state reset upon assets withdrawal 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The deposit function checks if a user has previously deposited by referencing the hasUserInvestedAlready function. If the user hasn't invested before, the contract then calls the setIfUserInvesting function which flags that the user has made an investment. There is no mechanism in place to undo or reset the investment flag once the user has withdrawn all their assets. This means that once a user invests, even if they later withdraw all their funds, the system will always consider them as having invested.

**Recommendation**: 

Just as there's a function to set the user's investment status, there should be a corresponding function that checks if the user has completely withdrawn their assets and resets their investment status.

**Fix**: The withdrawAndResetInvestmentStatus function has been added and is invoked when users completely withdraw their assets. 


### Unable to set stale price delay if initialized less than 1 hour

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiOracle.sol, the method `intializeStalePriceDelay(...)` initializes the stale prices for tokens of an aFiContract without checking if it’s greater than 1 hour.

If any token’s stale price delay is set for less than an hour accidentally, it can not be updated later on using setStalePriceDelay(...) due to the following check:
```solidity
   require(stalePriceDelay[aFiContract][uToken] > 1 hours, "AFO01");
```

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check in intializeStalePriceDelay(...) to ensure all initialized values are greater than an hour or modify the check-in setStalePriceDelay as follows:
```solidity
   require(stalePriceDelay[aFiContract][uToken] > 0, "AFO01");
```

### Missing length checks

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiMarnager.sol, the method `setSlippage(...)` needs to check that the length of uToken and slippage factor arrays are the same.

In Contract AFiOracle.sol, the method `intializeStalePriceDelay(...)` needs to check that the length of underlyingTokens and _stalePriceDelay are the same.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check to ensure arrays have equal lengths.

## Informational

### Remove commented & unused code

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiStorage.sol, many lines of commented code should be removed if not needed before production deployment.

In Contract AFiStorage.sol, the following check is not useful at multiple places. Please remove.
```solidity
validateGreaterEqual(
           balanceCompoundInToken(tok, afiContract),           balanceCompoundInToken(tok, afiContract).sub(1)
         );
```
**Recommendation**: 

Remove the commented or unused code.



### Unnecessary decimal normalization for Chainlink price feeds

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**


The checkIfUSDC function from AFiStorage contract is designed to determine the price of a given token (tok) in terms of USDC. The function utilizes Chainlink oracles to retrieve the latest price data. However, it uses logic to adjust for potential variations in decimal precision of the price data returned from Chainlink. In reality, all Chainlink price feeds that offer a rate for non-ETH pairs consistently return values with 8 decimal precision. Therefore, this normalization logic is redundant and adds unnecessary complexity.

**Recommendation**: 

The function should be simplified by removing any logic related to adjusting based on different decimal precision.
Fix: The issue has been fixed as recommended.

### Hardcoded `SLIPPAGE_FACTOR` in `initializePlatformData` function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**


The `initializePlatformData` function within the AFiBase contract has hardcoded the value of the SLIPPAGE_FACTOR to be 6, which is too low for highly volatile assets and it will be necessary to change it. 

**Recommendation**: 

Consider passing the `SLIPPAGE_FACTOR`as a function argument during the AToken creation.
**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.


### Insufficient tracking of underlying tokens stake across different AFiToken products

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The `_isStake` mapping in the current implementation provides a binary indicator of whether a uToken is staked within the protocol, lacking detail on the specific AFiToken product it's staked in. This can lead to challenges in accurately tracking assets and ensuring they're correctly accounted for, if the same uToken is staked in multiple AFiToken products.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider implementing a 2D mapping associating each underlying token with the respective AFiToken it's staked in.

**Fix**: 

The issue has been fixed as recommended.

### `onlyOnce` mapping can be set outside the loop

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiStorage.sol, the following mapping in setTeamWallet method can be set once the for loop ends
```solidity
onlyOnce[aFiContract] = true;
```
**Recommendation**: 

Update the method to set the mapping onlyOnce for a aFiContract outside the for loop.

**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.



### The method `recommend` can be optimized

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiStorage.sol, the method recommend() can be updated as follows.
```solidity
uint max = 0;
Lender newProvider = Lender.NONE;
if (capr > max) {
max = capr;
newProvider = Lender.COMPOUND;
}
if (aapr > max) {
max = aapr;
newProvider = Lender.AAVE;
}
if (dapr > max) {
max = dapr;
newProvider = Lender.DYDX;
}
return (newProvider, max);
```

**Recommendation**: 

Update the `recommend()` method as above.

**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.



### `_withdrawAll` is not allowed for afiBase contract

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiBase.sol, the method `_withdrawAll(...)` can be called by AFiManager, AFiStorage, and AFiBase(this) contract as per the natspec comments.

But the check allows AFiManager and AFiStorage contracts only.
```solidity
require(msg.sender == address(aFiStorage) || msg.sender == aFiManager, "AB16");
```
**Recommendation**: 

Update the comment to remove the AFiBase or update the method to allow AFiBase contract as well.


**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.


### Risk of adding team wallet more than once for an aFiBase contract

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract AFiStorage.sol, method `addTeamWallet(...)` is used to add a team wallet to any aFiBase contract. Since there is no check if the wallet already exists for that particular aFiBase contract, and also later on contract can be upgraded to allow other contracts or EOAs to add team wallets, there is a risk of a team wallet being added more than once.

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to check in addTeamWallet(...) method if the wallet already exists or not.

**Fix**: The issue has been fixed as recommended.

### Unnecessary nested mapping

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract AFiStorage.sol, the variables aaveTokenCopy, compoundCopy, dTokenCopy are a mapping of type (address => (address => address)).

Here, the first key is the aFiBase Contract address, the second key is the uToken address and the value is the protocol contract address.

Since the first key is the aFibase contract address, the uToken and value address will be repeated for each aFibase contract.

For eg:
```solidity
aaveTokenCopy[0xaa…aa1][0xbb..bb1] = 0xcc..cc1
aaveTokenCopy[0xaa…aa1][0xbb..bb2] = 0xcc..cc2
aaveTokenCopy[0xaa…aa2][0xbb..bb1] = 0xcc..cc1
aaveTokenCopy[0xaa…aa2][0xbb..bb2] = 0xcc..cc2
```
To store the protocol contract address, it is sufficient to store it with the utoken address as the key.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the mapping as `aaveTokenCopy(address => address)` and so on.
