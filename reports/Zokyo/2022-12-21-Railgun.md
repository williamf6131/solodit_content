# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Transaction validation is out of the scope

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: RailgunLogic.sol

**Function**: validateTransaction

**Details**:

The current implementation of the in-scope functions does not validate unshieldPreimage to contain a correct value. Without such validation, anyone could call a function providing its own address and get all tokens.

**Recommendation**: 

make sure Verifier.verify function is audited and does all necessary verifications and validations."		

### Possible re-entrancy

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: RailgunSmartWallet.sol

**Function**: transact

**Details**:

In the case there'll be an ERC20 token with the callback functionality within the transfer method or an ERC721 within the transferFrom method, it's possible to have a re-entrancy attack.

**Recommendation**: 

make sure that the same Transaction could not be sent twice withing one blockchain tx. This could be done, for example, by marking the hash as processed before sending any tokens.

## Informational

### Unnecessary contract name specified

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**File**: RailgunLogic.sol

**Function**: transferTokenIn

**Details**:

While calling the getFee function on the line#258 the third argument is specified as: RailgunLogic.shieldFee. We double-checked the code and there is no any reason of clarifying the contract name for the given state variable

**Recommendation**: 

replace the argument with simple shieldFee
