# Findings

## Informational

### Unused import

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The XyroToken contract imports both ERC20.sol and ERC20Permit.sol.
However, ERC20Permit.sol already imports ERC20.sol and the token contract doesnâ€™t need to import ERC20.sol separately.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the duplicate import.

### Unnecessary variable declarations

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The XyroToken contract declares _balances, _totalSupply, _name, and _symbol variables but they are already declared in ERC20.sol and the variables are not used in the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove duplicate variable declarations.

### Unnecessary function declaration

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The XyroToken contract overrides the _update() function but the function just calls super._update() without any modifications.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the function in the contract.

### Floating pragma

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contract uses a floating pragma version (^0.8.24). Contracts should be deployed using the same compiler version and settings as were used during development and testing. Locking the pragma version helps ensure that contracts are not inadvertently deployed with a different compiler version. Using an outdated pragma version could introduce bugs that negatively affect the contract system, while newly released versions may have undiscovered security vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider locking the pragma version to a specific, tested version to ensure consistent compilation and behavior of the smart contract.
