# Findings

## Low Risk

### Unused constant

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: legacymigration.go

**Constant**: tagTrytesSize

**Details**:

The given file has a constant "tagTrytesSize," which is never used in the code. As far as it was added to a code within only one commit, it could be a part of some unfinished business logic. 

**Recommendation**:

Please double-check if this constant is unneeded; if not, just remove it from the code.		

### Panics instead of errors

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: legacymigration.go

**Function**: legacyAddressBytesFromTrytes

**Details**:

The given function checks for the length of the given "trytes" parameter, and if it doesn't comply with the values of the constants, then it panics. Having a panic could be unexpected to the functions above who called this one (through the chain of "addressesFromBundle"). 

**Recommendation**:

It would be better to return an error, check for it, and return the error from the "addressesFromBundle" function as well.	

### Inconsistency in constant usage

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: legacymigration.go

**Function**: legacyAddressBytesFromTrytes

**Details**:

The given function accesses two constants: "hashTrytesSize" and "consts.AddressWithChecksumTrytesSize". The first one is declared right above the function itself and is assigned a value from the other constant: "consts.HashTrytesSize". It would be more logical to either have a local constant to hold both external constants to use in the function, or to use external constants in the function.

**Recommendation**:

It would be better to return an error, check for it, and return the error from the "addressesFromBundle" function as well.
