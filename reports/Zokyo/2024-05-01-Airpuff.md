## Medium Risk

### The decimal unit discrepancy in `lockedVeTokenUsdcValue` Function

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: EligibilityDataProvider.sol

**Description**

The `lockedVeTokenUsdcValue` function does not accurately return the value in proper decimal units.
```solidity
return (veTokenAmount * price) / 10 ** 18; 
```

The issue arises because both `veTokenAmount` and price are treated as if they are in 18 decimal units.

In the latest commit of `PriceProviderMain`, the `updatePrice` function is used to update the price. The resulting `priceOfAPuffInEth` is calculated using 18 decimal units:
```solidity
// [AUDIT] the result decimal units of priceOfAPuffInEth equals the decimal units of price
uint256 priceOfAPuffInEth = 1e18 / priceOfEthInApuff; //1 Apuff to eth
```
This discrepancy in decimal units leads to incorrect calculations in the lockedVeTokenUsdcValue function since the return value is assumed to be in usdc decimals (i.e. 6).

**Fix** - Issue addressed and resolved in commit 49f8237 .

### Incomplete user position update due to missing function invocation

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: VotingEscrowSidechain.sol

**Description**

If `cic.afterLockUpdate(userAddr)` is not invoked in the `_setNewUserPosition` function, the `userInfo` records will not be updated as expected. This occurs because the `_handleActionAfterForToken` function in the `ChefIncentivesController` contract is not triggered.
```solidity
   function _setNewUserPosition(bytes memory userData) internal {
        (address userAddr, LockedPosition memory position) = abi.decode(userData, (address, LockedPosition));
        positionData[userAddr] = position;
        //  cic.afterLockUpdate(userAddr); 
        emit SetNewUserPosition(position);
    }
```

Without invoking `cic.afterLockUpdate(userAddr)`, the expected update of `userInfo` records will not occur, leading to potential inconsistencies in the system.

**Recommendation** 

Ensure that the `cic.afterLockUpdate(userAddr)` function is invoked in the `_setNewUserPosition` function to accurately update `userInfo` records and maintain consistency in the system.

**Fix** - Client implemented a new feature change that requires the user to request the update manually by calling the `requestUpdate` function in the `ChefIncentivesController` contract. Therefore issue is no longer relevant in this context and considered resolved.

### Overwriting of values possible in `VotingEscrowSidechain`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In `VotingEscrowSidechain.sol`, the  `_executeMessage()` function should be used with caution as it can lead to overwriting of user's positions if called twice for the same user in a contract that inherits this contract. This is because `_executeMessage()` function calls `_setNewUserPosition()` internally which is responsible for setting `positionData` of a user.
Similarly, `_setNewTotalSupply()` should be called and used with caution as it can lead to arbitrary setting of total supply or change in its value.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to avoid and prevent calling of `_executeMessage()` function internally more than once for the same user in order to avoid overwriting of `positionData`.
**Comments**: The client said that under the current mechanism, the only way to invoke `_executeMessage()` is by calling `increaseLockPositionAndBroadcast()` on `VotingEscrowMainchain`, which will send a cross-chain message via layer zero endpoints to update the balance. 

Thus overwriting of values is expected as users either: 
1) lock more tokens for more veToken
2) Set a new expiry date 

And that the behavior is consistent with the business logic. 

## Low Risk

### Centralization Risk

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: All

**Description**

The vulnerability in the contracts arises from the excessive authority granted to the admin, presenting a centralization issue. The core concern lies in the admin's unrestricted access to critical functions and general setters. This concentration of power raises significant concerns, particularly when certain functions carry higher risks than others. To address this issue, it is recommended to consider implementing governance mechanisms or utilizing multisig wallets. These measures can help distribute control among multiple entities and mitigate potential risks associated with the centralized authority of a single wallet.

**Recommendation**

- Use multisig wallets for critical administrative functions to require multiple approvals.
- Implement governance mechanisms to involve stakeholders in decision-making.
- Apply role-based access control to limit access based on predefined roles.

**Comments**: The team said that the Contract Ownership will be transferred to a multisig wallet with address: 0x308EeBaAd30f7fCcb57B5D92993A4399B6503E4F 

### Risk calling recover on APUFFToken

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: ChefIncentivesController.sol

**Description**

The smart contract contains a function named `recoverERC20` that allows the owner to withdraw an arbitrary amount of an arbitrary ERC20 token (tokenAddress) and transfer it to a `msg.sender`. While this functionality provides flexibility for the owner to recover funds, there is a flaw in how it handles withdrawals of the contract's underlying Token (i.e. APUFFToken).
```solidity
   function recoverERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
        _recoverERC20(tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
    }
```
When the owner calls `recoverERC20` with token set to the APUFFToken, it triggers a transfer of the token from the contract to the owner. However, since the contract's accounting is likely based on the underlying token, this withdrawal could lead to inconsistencies or incorrect accounting records.

**Recommendation**

**Restrict APUFFToken Withdrawals**: Modify the `recoverERC20` function to prevent the withdrawal of the underlying token. This can be achieved by implementing additional checks or by explicitly excluding the token from the list of tokens eligible for withdrawal in recoverERC20.
**Fix** - Issue addressed and resolved in commit 49f8237 .

### Improving Accuracy of Timestamp Comparison in `isTimeInThePast` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: MiniHelpers.sol

**Description**

In the `isTimeInThePast` function, the comparison `timestamp <= block.timestamp` is used to determine if a given timestamp is in the past. However, if the timestamp is equal to the current time (block.timestamp), it technically represents the current moment and should not be considered as being in the past, contrary to the function name suggests.

**Recommendation** 

To accurately determine if a timestamp is in the past, it is recommended to use a strictly less than comparison (<) rather than less than or equal to (<=).
```solidity
   function isTimeInThePast(uint256 timestamp) internal view returns (bool) {
        return (timestamp <= block.timestamp); // same definition as isCurrentlyExpired
    }
```
**Comments**: The client said that in the context of its application, neither time in the past nor current timestamp is acceptable (as tokens have to be locked for at least 1 week). And thus decided to continue with the current implementation.

### Centralized Control Over Delegator Assignments

**Severity**: Low

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description**: 

The `VotingEscrowSidechain` contract allows for the assignment of delegators through the `setDelegatorFor` function, which is only callable by the owner. This centralization grants the owner unilateral control to redirect the benefits or functionalities tied to a user's position to another address, potentially leading to misuse or manipulation without user consent.
Scenario: If the owner's account is compromised, an attacker could redirect the delegations to addresses under their control, effectively seizing control over the rewards or entitlements of legitimate users.

**Recommendation**:

Implement a governance mechanism involving multiple stakeholders or a DAO for sensitive operations like setting delegators

### Use `Ownable2Step` instead of Ownable

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

Ownableupgradeable.sol contract has been used across the codebase.It uses the `transferOwnership()` function in contract allows the current admin to transfer his privileges to another address. However, inside `transferOwnership()` , the `newOwner` is directly stored into the storage owner, after validating the `newOwner` is a non-zero address, and immediately overwrites  the current owner. 

This can lead to cases where the admin has transferred ownership to an incorrect address and wants to revoke the transfer of ownership or in the cases where the current admin comes to know that the new admin has lost access to his account.
 
**Recommendation**
It is advised to `Ownable2Step` upgradeable contract instead which uses a 2 step mechanism to transfer ownership.

### Missing zero address checks

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

In `MsgReceiverAppUpg.sol`, there is missing zero address check for `_pendleMsgReceiveEndpoint` parameter in the `__MsgReceiverAppUpg_init()` function.
Similarly, in `MsgSendEndpointUp.sol` there is  missing zero address check for `_refundAddress` and `_lzEndpoint` parameters in the `initialize()` function. Once set, they cannot be changed again.
In addition to that, in the `VotingEscrowMainchain.sol`  there is missing zero address checks for `_protocolToken` and `_cic` parameters of `initialize()` function. Once set, `protocolToken` and `cic` cannot be changed again. Consider adding a zero address check for the same.
Similarly, in `ChefIncentivesController.sol`, there is missing zero address check for `_veContract` parameter in the initialize.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to add zero address checks for the same in the following contracts:

1) `_pendleMsgReceiveEndpoint` parameter in MsgReceiverAppUpg’s `__MsgReceiverAppUpg_init()` function.
2) `_refundAddress` & `_lzEndpoint` parameters in MsgSendEndpointUp.sol’s `initialize()` function.
3) `_protocolToken` & `_cic` parameters of `initialize()` function in `VotingEscrowMainchain.sol`
4) `_veContract` parameter of the `initialize()` function in `ChefIncentivesController.sol`


###  CEI not followed in `VotingEscrowMainchain`

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

In `VotingEscrowMainchain.sol`, the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern has not been followed in `increaseLockPosition()` function. It is always a best practice to follow checks effects interactions pattern.
The external call is on line: 108
```solidity
           protocolToken.safeTransferFrom(user, address(this), additionalAmountToLock);
```
**Recommendation**

It is advised to follow CEI pattern in `increaseLockPosition()` and recommended to add the external call at the end of the function after all the state changes.
**Comments**: The client said that they will keep the current implementation as they consider to allow users to transfer fund (protocol token in this case) to the contract first, then execute some logic to update balance is arguably safer than straightly implementing CEI pattern.  

## Informational

### Lock Time Constants

**Severity**: Informational 

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description**: 

In the `VotingEscrowMainchain` contract the constants for maximum and minimum lock times (`MAX_LOCK_TIME` and `MIN_LOCK_TIME`) are hardcoded, limiting flexibility and adaptability to evolving stakeholder needs or governance decisions.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider making these parameters governable by allowing their values to be adjusted through proposals and voting by token holders or a governance

### Potential for DDoS through Block Gas Limit

**Severity**: Informational 

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description**: 

In `ChefIncentivesController` contract, The functions `batchUpdateAllocPoint` and `_massUpdatePools` iterate through all pools to update their states. As the number of pools grows, these functions may require gas that exceeds the block gas limit, rendering them unusable.

**Scenario**:

As the number of reward pools increases, executing these functions may consistently fail due to exceeding the block gas limit, leading to denial of service where no updates can be performed.

**Recommendation**: 

Restructure the update mechanism to handle a fixed number of updates per transaction or use patterns like the "checkpointing" system to spread state updates over multiple transactions.

**Comments**: The client said that the pools that are entitled to emission on each chain are limited. And that judging from the experience from the protocol they reference from (e.g. Pendle) denial of service is not likely to happen.


###  Emission Rate Manipulation through Unrestricted Function Access

**Severity**: informational 

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description**: 

In `ChefIncentivesController` contract, the function `setRewardsPerSecond` is only restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier. There is a potential risk if ownership is transferred either mistakenly or through a breach, allowing an unauthorized user to manipulate the emission rate.

**Scenario**:

If the ownership of the contract is compromised, the unauthorized owner could set an extremely high rewards rate, leading to rapid depletion of funds or unfair distributions.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement additional governance mechanisms or multi-signature requirements for critical functions like setting the emission rate, or use a time lock for sensitive operations to provide an opportunity for recovery before changes go into effect.

**Comments**: Contract Ownership will be transferred to a multisig wallet: 0x308EeBaAd30f7fCcb57B5D92993A4399B6503E4F 

### Insufficient Validation of Function Parameters

**Severity**: informational 

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description**:  

In `ChefIncentivesController` contract, the functions initialize, `addPool`, and `setRewardsPerSecond` lack sufficient validation for their parameters. Specifically, the initialize function does not validate non-zero values for the `_poolConfigurator`, `_eligibleDataProvider`, and `_APUFFToken`. Meanwhile, `addPool` does not prevent adding a token with zero allocation points, which could affect the rewards distribution logic.

**Scenario**:

- **Zero-value Parameters**: Functions that initialize critical contract settings allow zero values, which can lead to operational failures or logical errors in reward calculations and distributions.
- **Zero Allocation Point**s: Adding a pool with zero allocation points could disrupt the proportional reward calculations across pools.

**Recommendation**:
Add stringent checks to ensure all parameters are correctly validated. For example, ensuring that token addresses are not zero and that allocation points are greater than zero before allowing pool addition.


###  Access Control in `setDqTime`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status** : Resolved

**Description**:  

In `EligibilityDataProvider` contract, the function `setDqTime` is designed to be exclusively invoked by the chef contract, indicated by the intended functionality "OnlyCIC". The current implementation uses a manual conditional check to enforce this access control within the function body. Although effective, this approach is less gas-efficient and can decrease code readability compared to the use of Solidity's built-in modifiers. Utilizing modifiers also aligns with best practices for maintaining clear, concise, and reusable code, which can mitigate risks related to future contract updates or modifications.

**Scenario**:

If an unauthorized address tries to invoke `setDqTime`, the contract depends on an if-statement check to throw an exception and revert the transaction. This method, while straightforward, consumes more gas due to the additional computational steps and is prone to errors in scenarios where contract logic becomes complex.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a dedicated modifier to handle access control for the `setDqTime` function. This would centralize the access control logic, making it easier to manage and potentially reducing gas costs by optimizing the conditional checks. For instance, defining a `onlyChef` modifier would encapsulate the access rule, enhance security

### Lack of event emission in vital functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: MsgSenderAppUpg.sol MsgSendEndpointUpg.sol MsgReceiveEndpointUpg.sol ChefIncentivesController.sol

**Description**:  

During the security audit of the smart contract, an issue has been identified in the implementation of privileged functions. The codebase has not incorporated event emission within several of the privileged functions. The absence of events in these operations limits transparency, hindering the ability to monitor and track critical changes to the contract's state.
Functions noted to miss events emission are:
```solidity
// MsgSenderAppUpg.sol
function addDestinationContract(address _address, uint256 _chainId) public payable 
function setApproxDstExecutionGas(uint256 gas) external 

// MsgSendEndpointUpg.sol
function addReceiveEndpoints(address endpointAddr, uint256 endpointChainId) external payable 
function setWhitelisted(address addr, bool status) external 
function setLzSendVersion(uint16 _newVersion) external 

// MsgReceiveEndpointUpg.sol
function setLzReceiveVersion(uint16 _newVersion) external 

// ChefIncentivesController
function start() public 
function addPool(address _token, uint256 _allocPoint) external 
function setAddressWLstatus(address user, bool status) external 
function toggleWhitelist() external 
```
**Recommendation** 

Emit the relevant events on calling privileged functions.
**Fix** - Issue addressed and resolved in commit 49f8237 .

### Ownable_init duplicated

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: VotingEscrowMainchain.sol/VotingEscrowSidechain.sol

**Description**:  

In both the `VotingEscrowMainchain` and `VotingEscrowSidechain` contracts, the `initialize()` function invokes the `__Ownable_init(msg.sender)` function, which sets the contract owner, and subsequently, within the same context, the `__MsgSenderAppUpg_init()` and `__MsgReceiverAppUpg_init()` functions also call `__Ownable_init(msg.sender)`.

**Recommendation**

Avoid calling the `__Ownable_init(msg.sender)` function multiple times within the same context to prevent unintended behavior or inconsistent state changes. Instead, ensure that the ownership initialization is performed only once, either in the `initialize()` function or in the `__MsgSenderAppUpg_init()` and `__MsgReceiverAppUpg_init()` functions, depending on the desired contract behavior. Additionally, review the contract architecture to ensure clarity and consistency in function calls and state initialization.
**Fix** - Issue addressed and resolved in commit 49f8237 .


### Missing __gap storage variable in VotingEscrowTokenBase Contract

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: VotingEscrowTokenBase.sol

**Description**:  

Contracts `VotingEscrowMainchain` and `VotingEscrowSidechain` inherit the `VotingEscrowTokenBase` contract in an upgradeable contract, but the `VotingEscrowTokenBase` contract does not incorporate the use of a `__gap` variable in storage. This absence of a `__gap` variable poses a risk in scenarios where upgrades may be required for the `VotingEscrowTokenBase` contract. Without a `__gap` variable, the storage layout of the base contract cannot be modified in a way that prevents interference with the storage layout of derived contracts during upgrades.

**Recommendation** 

To address this issue, consider updating the VotingEscrowTokenBase contract to include a __gap variable in storage.
**Fix** - Issue addressed and resolved in commit 49f8237 .

### Lack of Input Validation for Empty Arrays in batchUpdateAllocPoint Function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: ChefIncetivesController.sol

**Description**:  

The `batchUpdateAllocPoint` function in `ChefIncentivesController.sol` lacks input validation for the `_tokens` and `_allocPoints` arrays. These arrays can be empty, yet there is no check to verify the presence of elements before proceeding with the function execution. As a result, the function may proceed with empty arrays, leading to unexpected behavior or unintended consequences due to the absence of data to process.
```solidity
function batchUpdateAllocPoint(address[] calldata _tokens, uint256[] calldata _allocPoints) external onlyOwner
```

**Recommendation**

To address this issue, it is recommended to implement input validation checks to ensure that both the _tokens and _allocPoints arrays contain valid data.
**Comments**: The client said that the validation checks in the loop will be costly.

### Floating Pragma Version in Solidity Files

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: All

**Description**:  

The Solidity files in this codebase contain pragma statements specifying the compiler version in a floating manner (e.g., ^0.8.x). Floating pragmas can introduce unpredictability in contract behavior, as they allow automatic adoption of newer compiler versions that may introduce breaking changes.

**Recommendation**: 

To ensure stability and predictability in contract behavior, it is recommended to:
Specify Fixed Compiler Version: Instead of using a floating pragma, specify a fixed compiler version to ensure consistency across different deployments and prevent automatic adoption of potentially incompatible compiler versions.

### Pending ToDo Comments in `ChefIncentivesController`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

There are TODOs on line: 308 and line: 363 in the `ChefIncentivesController.sol` contract. Pending todo comments are not advised during the deployment of code in production.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to complete the TODOs in the code and not leave the code logic incomplete before deployment of the contracts in production.
