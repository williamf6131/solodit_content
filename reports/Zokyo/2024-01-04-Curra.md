# Findings

## High Risk


### Anyone can upgrade an implementation

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: src/ERC1967Factory.sol

**Details**:

While the admin is not checked anymore, and both functions upgrade and upgradeAndCall have become public, anyone could call them and change the implementation.

**Recommendation**:

Make sure the upgradeAndCall function is either private or internal while the upgrade function is internal.		

## Low Risk

### Updated implementation of the ERC1967Factory

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: src/ERC1967Factory.sol

**Details**:

A newer implementation for the ERC1967Factory is available at its author's repository under commit hash: `9833cc764901b603398012b6f3b48930a7418f80`. It saves even more gas.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider updating the ERC1967Factory library.		

### Unnecessary admin of proxy

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: src/ERC1967Factory.sol

**Details**:

While the original ERC1967Factory implementation uses admin to control the access to some functions in the contract itself, there is no need for this in your modified implementation. The deploy function is internal now, and access to it is being checked outside of the contract. Removing usage of the admin slot could save even more gas.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider removing the admin slot from the contract.		

## Informational

### Unused constant

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: src/ERC1967Factory.sol

**Constant**: _SALT_DOES_NOT_START_WITH_CALLER_ERROR_SELECTOR

**Details**:

The constant is declared but never used. You can save gas by removing it.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove unsued constant		

### Unused constant

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: src/ERC1967Factory.sol

**Constant**: _ADMIN_CHANGED_EVENT_SIGNATURE

**Details**:

The constant is declared but never used. You can save gas by removing it.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove unsued constant		

### Wrong solidity version

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: src/ERC1967Factory.sol

**Details**:

The ERC1967Factory declares to use the solidity compiler version "^0.8.4" which allows older versions.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider using the same pragma version for all solidity files in the project.		

### Missing zero address validation

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: src/Forwarder.sol

**Line**: #17

**Details**:

The constructor accepts an argument "rule" but doesn't validate it to be a non-zero address. There's also no way to change this address later (it's immutable).

**Recommendation**: 

Check that the address is not zero.
