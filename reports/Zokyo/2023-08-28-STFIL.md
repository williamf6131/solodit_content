# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Interest Value Can Be Incorrect If Unstaked Amount Is Sent Back To The Pool

**Severity** -  Medium

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

Inside StakingPool.sol , while unstaking at L144 , if the user provides the pool address itself (StakingPool’s address) as the to address , then essentially the pool address receives the liquidity back increasing liquidity , therefore the interest calculation at L159 would be incorrect since it’s  reserve.updateInterestRates(address(this),0,amountToUnstake) , meaning amountToStake is leaving the pool(liquidity removed) but it’s not the case here since the liquidity is being added back.

**Recommendation**:

There can be 2 solution , the ideal solution would be to have a check require(to != address(this)) or have an if condition to see if to address is the current address , if it is then 
Update interest as reserve.updateInterestRates(address(this),amountToUnstake,0)


### Liquidations Should Not Be Paused If Contract Is Paused

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

The contract StakingPool can be paused by the staking pool configurator in cases of emergency , once paused functions borrow , stake , unstake , withdraw , repay and liquidation can not be executed due to the whenNotPaused modifier.

If liquidations are paused , the protocol can incur huge losses due to unhealthy node debt positions . It is always advisable to resume liquidations in cases of emergency too.

When the StakingPool contract is paused , repayments and liquidations are paused . The debt of a node is calculated through its debt tokens (variable and stable) balance. These tokens are interest accruing tokens. It is possible that while the contract is paused , a user’s position becomes subject to liquidation. 
An attacker can set up a front-running bot , as soon as the contract is resumed the bot calls liquidate on the user’s position without giving the user a chance to repay.

**Recommendation**: 

Just resuming liquidations will not  be the complete fix , resume repayments too while contract is paused , as if liquidations are unpaused and repayments are paused then positions can be liquidated without giving users the chance to repay/keep their positions healthy.

## Low Risk

### Owner Not Assigned As Operator Inside delegateBeneficiary

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Invalid

**Description**

Inside NodeOperations.sol the function delegateBeneficiary should assign the owner as the operator according to the comment at L83 . But this is not done  , we only assign the owner as the 0-address but not the operator as the owner.

**Recommendation**:

Assign the owner as the operator, then assign the owner as 0 address.

Comment: This was found out to be intented/feature after discussion with the client.


### No Incentive For Liquidator

**Severity** - Low 

**Status** - Acknowledged 

**Description**

Liquidations are supposed to clear bad debt of an unhealthy position , and in the process incentivize the liquidator. Inside StakingPool is implemented the liquidation() function at L344, the flow of the liquidation process is as follows ->
Calculate the debt of the node and then calculate the positionToLiquidate
Calculate paybackAfterLiquidation , which is the payback returned to the pool.
Burn the bad debt of the node.
Withdraw appropriate position from the node to the pool.

Throughout this process , the liquidator(msg.sender) was not rewarded , making this process
Infeasible for the liquidator.

**Recommendation**:

Have a reward system for the liquidator.

**Client Comment**: 

In this protocol, liquidation is a low-frequency operation with low real-time requirements, and it is planned to provide incentives in the governance process.





### Centralization Risks

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Description**

The CONTRACTS_ADMIN_ROLE holds a lot of power , inside StakingPoolAddressProvider.sol, it can upgrade the proxy to a new implementation address and set the proxy to a new address. These are all most critical functions.

**Recommendation**:

Ensure the CONTRACTS_ADMIN_ROLE is a multisig or has a timelock for system critical functions.


### Attacker Can Grief A User Who Is Unstaking

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Acknowledged 

**Description**

When a user unstakes , it is checked that the amount being unstaked is at most the FIL balance in the pool (L156).
An attacker can frontrun a user’s unstake call , call borrow() and borrow all or almost all the FIL inside the pool , this would make the user’s tx revert.
The attacker can then (after the victim’s tx fail) instantly repay the borrow.
This way attacker can continue to grief unstake calls.

**Recommendation**:

If the pool does not have enough FIL mint the user a different token which can be swapped for FIL later when there is liquidity inside the pool , 


### Misleading Event Emitted From a State Changing Action

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

StakingPoolConfigurator.sol -
```solidity
 function setLiquidationFactor(uint256 liquidationFactor) external onlyPoolAdmin {
    DataTypes.PoolConfigurationMap memory currentConfig = pool.getReserveData().configuration;
    currentConfig.setLiquidationFactor(liquidationFactor);
    pool.setPoolConfiguration(currentConfig.data);

    emit PoolFeeChanged(liquidationFactor);
  }
```

This mixes things up with
 function setFee(uint256 fee) external 

as they emit the same event.

**Recommendation** 

setLiquidationFactor requires a new event created for it to be emitted on calling the function.

### Lack of Slippage Argument for Stake and Unstake

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Invalid

**Description**

StakingPool.sol - In stake() a determined amount of native coin is being deposited in exchange of STFIL ERC20 to be minted for the user. The minted amount out relies on a mathematical formula that can be manipulated via a front running attack.
ISTFILToken(reserve.stFILAddress).mint(onBehalfOf, amount, reserve.liquidityIndex);

Attackers might front run their transaction in order to affect the value of reserve.liquidityIndex from which it affects the minted amount for the user. This generally causes upset among users.
The same issue is also shown in the opposite direction: unstake(). 

**Fix**: Considered "Invalid" because contract PoolReserveLogic which shows that dependency is out of scope of the Audit.

**Recommendation** 

Add an argument for minimumAmountReceived which the user can put so that the transaction should fail if the amount to be received does not fit the user's desire.


### Out of scope Dependencies

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged 

**Description**

In the contract, `StakingPool.sol` makes critical external calls to the unaudited `reserve` contract to update the state. As such, it is treated as a black box and is assumed to be correct. However, in the real world, contracts can be volatile and unaudited code cannot be guaranteed to work as intended.
In the contract, `STFILToken.sol`, `VariableDebtToken.sol`, and `StableDebtToken.sol` use external unaudited calls to `normalize()`.

**Recommendation**: 

We recommend ensuring that the `PoolReserveLogic.sol` and `FilAddress.sol` contracts contain no errors, and it cannot interfere with future iterations of the protocol.

**Comment from client**: 

In Filecoin, contracts generally have multiple addresses. Two of these address types, f0 and f410f, can be converted to 0x-style (Ethereum) addresses which can be used in the CALL opcode. Refer to https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/filecoin-evm-runtime/differences-with-ethereum/#multiple-addresses.

## Informational

### Return Value Of Mint Function Not Clear

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

Inside VariableDebtToken’s mint() function at L72 we return true if the previous balance was 0 , the significance of returning true for this case is unclear. If it is essential for the function to return true , then it’s return value should be checked inside StakingPool contract at L205
Similarly , true is returned for StableDebtToken too.


**Recommendation**:

Add more clarity on the purpose of returning true if the previous balance is 0 , and if it is significant check the returned value. 


### Wrong Error Description

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved 

**Description**

Inside StakingPool.sol at L355 , the error is DEBT_RATE_MORE_THAN_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD , while it should have been DEBT_RATE_LESS_THAN_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD

**Recommendation**:

Change to the above suggested name.


### Lack Of Documentation

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved  

**Description**

There are a lot of parts in the code which are not well documented/lack natspec. Inside StableDebtToken there are no comments about the state variables. Other areas could have more in-depth information. As liquid staking is a highly complex topic, there are key areas that need to be addressed for users to understand the protocol. With derivatives available to users, this adds more complexity to the issue. Users should understand exactly what their leverage gains them. For Example: Explaining how leveraging gains them a larger passive “Block Reward”. Explaining the use case for liquid staking and what makes this important. 

**Recommendation**: 

Adding sufficient documentation for all users to understand what liquid staking is and how leverage affects this. 

Have property comments/natspec for state variables too.


### Node Owners are Allowed to Liquidate Themselves

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**:  Invalid

**Description**

In StakingPool.sol - Function liquidation(uint64 actorId) enables the node owners to liquidate themselves. This is an uncommon pattern in DeFi projects as the owner repays debt while other wallets can liquidate the owner when the position approaches insolvency.

**Fix**: 

This is not having any negative effect on contract’s security and being informed by client that this is in fact needed as a spec. Therefore the issue is considered invalid.

**Recommendation** 

Validate that caller is not the node owner.

### Missing Emit Events from Privileged Functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

In StakingPool.sol
 function setPoolConfiguration(uint256 configuration) external override onlyStakingPoolConfigurator {
    _reserve.configuration.data = configuration;
  }

In NodeOperation.sol
 function setNodeConfiguration(uint64 actorId, uint256 configuration) external override onlyStakingPoolConfigurator {
    _nodes[actorId].configuration.data = configuration;
  }
  
**Recommendation** 

Emit events on important changes.
 
### Floating Pragma

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved  

**Description**

Throughout the codebase, the contracts that are unlocked at version ^0.8.0, and it should always be deployed with the same compiler version. By locking the pragma to a specific version, contracts are not accidentally getting deployed by using an outdated version that can introduce unintended consequences.

**Recommendation**: 

Lock the compiler version to a specific. Known bugs are featured here.

### Typos

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

In the following documentation diagram, Librarys is spelled incorrectly and should be changed to Libraries.

**Recommendation**: 

It is recommended that the typos be changed.
