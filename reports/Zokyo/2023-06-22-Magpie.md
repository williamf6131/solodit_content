## High Risk

### Lack of access control in increaseLockTime function enables unauthorized position lock

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The increaseLockTime() function in the PendleStaking contract allows anyone to lock the position of a PendleStaking for up to 104 weeks. The function takes an _unlockTime parameter, which represents the duration in seconds, to increase the lock time. Then, it invokes the increaseLockPosition function from the IPVotingEscrowMainchain contract, passing 0 as a pendle amount to be pulled in from user to lock and the calculated unlockTime as the lock duration. The vulnerability arises from the lack of access control or permission checks in this function. As a result, any address can call this function and increase the lock time for the position without any restrictions. 

**Recommendation**: 

Consider implementing proper access controls or permission checks in the increaseLockTime() function.
Comment from the client team: I don't think, this needs to be changed because we want the lock period to increase eventually and, the Pendle side is already checking this for us, if the lock time is not greater than last time then it will set the old lock time and if we want to change it, then we have to add timestamp at the time of deployment and do the calculation of unlock time with that in convertpendle, so timestamp will not increase, I haven't touched this



### Execution flow in _onlyWhiteListed modifier leaves modified function unexecuted

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The MasterPenPIe._onlyWhiteListed() modifier checks whether the sender is part of the AllocationManagers, PoolManagers, or is the contract owner. If any of these conditions are satisfied, the modifier executes a return statement and immediately exits the function, bypassing the execution of the modified function entirely. As a result, the _; symbol after the return statements are unreachable, and the modified function does not execute.
As a result, in the MasterPenPie.updatePoolsAlloc() function, which utilizes the _onlyWhiteListed() modifier, if the calling address is whitelisted, the modifier will prevent the execution of the function. This means that the allocation points for staking tokens will not be updated.
```ts
       it("Invalid modifier execution flow", async () => {
           let stakingToken1: StandardTokenMock;
           stakingToken1 = await setup.newToken(20, 50)
           let allocPoint1 = ether(200)


           let totalAllocBefore = await masterPenPie.totalAllocPoint();


           await deposit(player1);
           await masterPenPie.updatePoolsAlloc([stakingToken1.address],[allocPoint1]);


           let totalAllocAfter = await masterPenPie.totalAllocPoint()
          
           expect((await masterPenPie.tokenToPoolInfo(stakingToken1.address)).allocPoint).to.eq(0)
           expect(totalAllocBefore).to.eq(totalAllocAfter);
       });
```
**Recommendation**

Modifying the _onlyWhiteListed() modifier as follows so as the execution flow will correctly proceed to the modified function:
```solidity
   modifier _onlyWhiteListed() {
       require(
           AllocationManagers[msg.sender] ||
           PoolManagers[msg.sender] ||
           msg.sender == owner(),
           "OnlyWhiteListedAllocaUpdator"
       );
       _;
}
```
**Fixed**: Issue fixed in commit 0470a8c.

## Low Risk

### Missing Reentrancy modifier in depositVlPenPieFor(...) and withdrawVlPenPierFor(...) methods

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract MasterPenPie, the methods depositVlPenPieFor(...) and withdrawVlPenPierFor(...) are missing non-reentrant modifier unlike other deposit and withdraw methods in the same contract, and they all are using the same internal method logic.

**Recommendation**: 

Add the non-reentrant modifier to the depositVlPenPieFor(...) and withdrawVlPenPierFor(...) methods.

**Fix**: Issue fixed in commit 4a8a2 

### Unrestricted Reactivation of Markets with Null Rewarder Address in PendleMarketDepositHelper Contract

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The PendleMarketDepositHelper contract currently possesses a potential vulnerability, where a removed market could be reactivated by an operator with a null rewarder address. The potential loophole lies in the combination of removePoolInfo and setPoolInfo functions.
When removePoolInfo is invoked, it doesn't just toggle the isActive flag to false, but it completely eliminates the PoolInfo structure, resetting both rewarder and isActive to their default values (which are address(0) and false respectively).
Subsequently, an operator or malicious actor with operator privileges can call setPoolInfo and set isActive to true, even if the rewarder address is null. This could potentially lead to unforeseen behavior or loss of funds, given that a null address is incapable of functioning as a rewarder.

**Proof of Concept**:

Consider a scenario where a market has an address referred to as 'marketAddress'.
The operator executes removePoolInfo(marketAddress).
The PoolInfo for 'marketAddress' is thereby removed, setting the rewarder to address(0) and isActive to false.
The operator or a potential attacker with operator privileges then executes setPoolInfo(marketAddress, address(0), true).
Consequently, the PoolInfo for 'marketAddress' is reactivated but with a null rewarder address.

**Recommendations**:

Prevent the possibility of markets being reactivated with a null rewarder address. Amend the setPoolInfo function to revert the process if the rewarder is the null address. This ensures that a market cannot be reactivated unless there's a valid rewarder

**Fixed**: Issue fixed in commit f2e27ad



### Missing length check for rewarders array in harvestVePendleReward function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The purpose of the harvestVePendleReward function is to distribute rewards to pools and perform fee transfers, but it fails to validate if the _rewarders array has the same length as the _pools array, potentially leading to out-of-bounds array access. The function expects both arrays to have the same length, assuming that each pool in the _pools array corresponds to a specific rewarder in the _rewarders array. However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the lengths of the two arrays match.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a validation check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the _pools and _rewarders arrays have the same length.

### Unused removePoolInfo function in PendleStaking contract 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The PendleMarketDepositHelper contract has the removePoolInfo and setPoolInfo functions, which are intended to be called only by an operator, as enforced by the _onlyOperator modifier. Inside the initializer of this contract, the PendleStaking contract is designated as the first operator. Its function to register a new pool (registerPool()) makes a call to the setPoolInfo function to add a rewarder and indicate that the pool is active. However, no function within the PendleStaking contract actually calls the removePoolInfo function. Consequently, the removePoolInfo function cannot be executed by the intended operator, which can lead to a discrepancy between the contract's design and its implementation.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider updating a relevant functionality within the PendleStaking contract to call the removePoolInfo function when necessary. This may involve adding a new function specifically designed to invoke the removePoolInfo functionality.


### Unlimited emission rate can be set for penPiePerSec

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract MasterPenPie, the method updateEmissionRate(...) can be used by the owner to set any emission rate which if set very high can be manipulated by the owner to obtain a high reward share as penPiePerSec  is used in reward calculation methods. 

**Recommendation**: 

Timelock-based ownership contract can be used to update the emission rate which will give time to other protocol users in such incidents.


### Unutilized bonus reward tokens functionality

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The addBonusRewardForAsset function in PendleStaking contract allows the owner to add bonus reward tokens associated with a specific market address. However, the bonus reward tokens stored in the assetToBonusRewards mapping are not utilized or accessed in any functionality within the Pendle staking contract, including the claimed functionality.
This means that although the addBonusRewardForAsset function allows for the addition of bonus reward tokens, there is no corresponding code that utilizes these tokens during the claim process or any other relevant functionality. As it does not directly affect the core functionality or security of the Pendle staking contract, it signifies a discrepancy between the existence of the bonus reward tokens in the assetToBonusRewards mapping and the lack of utilization within the contract. 

**Recommendation**: 

Review the intended functionality and purpose of the bonus reward tokens and the addBonusRewardForAsset function. If the bonus reward tokens are intended to serve a specific purpose, such as being distributed to stakers during the claim process, ensure that the relevant functionality is implemented within the contract. Otherwise, consider removing the function and the corresponding storage of bonus reward tokens from the contract.

### Upgradeable contracts missing method to disable initializers for implementation contracts

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract PendleStaking.sol, Contract mPendleConverter.sol, Contract PendleMarketDepositHelper.sol and Contract MasterPenPie have imported the `Initializable` contract and using `initializer` modifier. It is recommended in OpenZeppelin’s documentation to not leave the implementation contract uninitialised as attacker can take advantage of the same and that may affect the proxy contract. 

**Recommendation**: 

Use this suggested method in OpenZeppelin’s documentation to mitigate this issue.

**Fix**: The issue was fixed partially in commit 4a8a2. The fix is missing in PendleMarketDepositHelper and MasterPenpie contract.
**Fix**: Issue fixed in commit 0097c



### Method convert(...) does not validate parameter `_mode` 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract mPendleConverter.sol, the method `convert(uint _amount, uint _mode)` has a comment mentioning _mode can be 0 or 1. It should be validated in the method logic as well.

**Recommendation**: 

Add the following require statement.
`require(_mode >=0 && _mode <=1, “Invalid mode”)`
In the future, if this _mode accepts other values, the `require` statement can be updated accordingly.



### Zero address validation missing for setPendleStaking

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In mPendleConverted.sol contract, the method `setPendleStaking(address _pendleStaking)` does not check if address _pendleStaking is zero-address or not. Setting a zero-address accidentally can cause DoS for method lockAllPendle().
 
**Recommendation**: 

Add zero-address validation for the _pendleStaking parameter. 

**Fix**: As of commit 0097c, issue is fixed.


### Lack of Input Validation in addBonusRewardForAsset function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The addBonusRewardForAsset function in the pendleStaking Contract is susceptible to lack of  input validation.
The function does not include checks to validate that the input addresses _market and _bonusToken are non-zero. This could potentially lead to misuse of the function, allowing the addition of invalid or zero addresses.
For input validation, the function does not prevent calls such as addBonusRewardForAsset(0x0, 0x0), which should typically be disallowed.

**Recommendations**:

Add checks to ensure that the _market and _bonusToken addresses are valid (non-zero) before proceeding with the function execution.

**Fixed**: Issue fixed in commit f2e27ad
**Client Comment** : No need for addBonusRewardForAsset function anymore since reward tokens are now directly from Pendle Market Token

### Missing Reentrancy checks in internal methods

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract PendleMarketDepositHelper.sol, the internal methods _depositMarket(...) and _withdrawMarket(...) missing non-reentrant modifier although it is imported, and these methods are used in public-facing methods such as depositMarket(...), depositMarketFor(...) and withdrawMarket(...).

**Recommendation**: 

It is recommended to add `nonReentrant` modifier in the _depositMarket(...) and _withdrawMarket(...) internal methods.

**Fix**: Issue fixed in commit 4a8a2 


### Missing check for the `newMinter` parameter if it’s an EOA

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract mPendleOFT.sol, the method `setMinter(address _newMinter)` sets a new minter to mint the mPendle token which should always be minted by mPendleConverter method only after the same amount of Pendle has been deposited to convert.
Setting an EOA as a minter risk minting mPendle tokens without depositing Pendle tokens.

**Recommendation**: 

It is recommended to add a check to ensure _newMinter is not an EOA.

## Informational

### Unused imports, events, custom errors and modifiers

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The code base contains unused imports, events, custom errors and modifiers that should be removed to improve code cleanliness and eliminate unnecessary dependencies.

       if (!poolInfo.isActive) revert OnlyActivePool();
       _;
   }
```

**Recommendation**: 

Consider removing listed dependencies from the code.

 
### Unbounded iteration in massUpdatePools function (MasterPenPie.sol)

**Severity**: Informational

**Status** : Acknowledged 

**Description**:

The massUpdatePools function iterates over all pool elements and updates them by calling updatePool. This could potentially cause the function to fail if the number of pools becomes too large, causing the transaction to consume more gas than the Ethereum block gas limit.

**Recommendation** :

Consider implementing a paginated approach in the massUpdatePools function. This can be accomplished by introducing two parameters, startIndex and endIndex in the function. This approach would allow the function to process a specified range of pools in each call, thereby limiting the number of loops in one transaction.

**Client Comment** : only for Pendle Finance integration, which pools number shouldn't go extreme

### Missing initialization of Reentrancy Guard Upgradeable Contract

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract PendleStaking.sol, Contract mPendleConverter.sol, Contract PendleMarketDepositHelper.sol and Contract MasterPenPie, these contracts inherits ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable which has an init method `__ReentrancyGuard_init` that needs to be called in the `initialize()`  to set the _status to NOT_ENTERED state.

**Recommendation**: 

Call the `__ReentrancyGuard_init` method in the `initialize()` method.

**Fix**: Issue is partially fixed as __ReentrancyGuard_init still missing in MasterPenpie_init 
**Fix**: Issue fixed in commit 0097c



### Missing initialization of PausableUpgradeable Contract

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Contract PendleStaking.sol, Contract mPendleConverter.sol, Contract PendleMarketDepositHelper.sol and Contract MasterPenPie, these contracts inherits PausableUpgradeable
which has an init method __Pausable_init that needs to be called in the `initialize()`  to set the _paused to `false` state.

**Recommendation**: 

Call the __Pausable_init method in the `initialize()` method.

### Reuse code by adding a modifier

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract PendleMarketDepositHelper.sol, the internal methods _depositMarket(...) and _withdrawMarket(...) are performing the same following check 
`if (!poolInfo[_market].isActive) revert DeactivatePool();` 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add the following modifier and use it in the internal methods _depositMarket(...) and _withdrawMarket(...). 

`modifier onlyActivePool(address market) {
	`if (!poolInfo[market].isActive) revert DeactivatePool();` 
_;
 }`

**Fix**: Issue fixed in commit 4a8a2 


### Missing events in methods called only by Operator and Admin 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the contract PendleMarketDepositHelper.sol, the methods setPoolInfo(...), removePoolInfo(...), and setOperator(...) make updated but do not emit logs.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to emit logs from the methods setPoolInfo(...), removePoolInfo(...) and setOperator(...).

### Wrong NatSpec comments

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract MasterPenPie.sol, the method stakingInfo(...) missing return parameter Natspec comments.

In Contract PendleStaking.sol, the method setFee(...) NatSpec comment is missing parameters comments.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the Natspec as per the methods.

**Fix**: Issue fixed in commit 4a8a2 


### Use specific Solidity compiler version

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Audited contracts use the following floating pragma:
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

It allows to compile contracts with various versions of compiler and introduces the risk of using a 
different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.

**Fix**: Issue fixed in commit 0097c

### Upgradeable contracts not using upgradeable smart contract libraries

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Contract PendleStaking.sol, Contract mPendleConverter.sol, Contract PendleMarketDepositHelper.sol, and Contract MasterPenPie uses OpenZeppelin contracts SafeERC20 and ERC20 which are not imported from the OpenZeppelin Upgradeable library as mentioned here in the OpenZeppelin documentation.

**Recommendation**: 

Use this suggested method in OpenZeppelin’s documentation to mitigate this issue.

### Redundant use of `this` keyword in the function invocations

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The convertPendle and convertAllPendles from PendleStaking contract use the `this` keyword keyword unnecessarily when invoking public functions. This results in the execution of a CALL opcode, which is gas expensive. When calling public functions within the same contract, there is no need to use this as the function calls can be made directly without the additional gas cost incurred by the CALL opcode.

**Recommendation**: 

Do not use `this` keyword when invoking public functions within the same contract.
