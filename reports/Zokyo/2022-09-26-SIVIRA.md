# Findings

## High Risk

### Unchecked possible zero address

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Identity.sol, at line 90 in function execute the to function parameter can be zero and is not checked. In case the to address is zero, the following to.call{value: value}(data) would return true and send the value to the zero address.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check for the to address variable to not be zero and revert otherwise.


### Centralization risk

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Identity, in function execute, an arbitrary module can send the funds from Identity contract to any other address. This behavior creates a major risk of centralization.

**Recommendation**: 

Modify the behavior of the contract, so that only the owner of the funds can have access to them.


## Medium Risk

### Unchecked possible zero address

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Identity.sol, at line 40 in function setOwner the newOwner function parameter can be zero and is not checked. The following function calls will not revert in case of a zero newOwner address, leading to undefined behavior, such as setting the owner to zero address.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check for the newOwner address to not be zero and revert otherwise.

### Unchecked possible zero address

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Identity.sol, at line 55 in function setModuleManager the newModuleManager function parameter can be zero and is not checked. In case the address is zero, the _moduleManager variable would be an interface initialized at a zero address. This would lead the call in the modifier onlyModule to fail, blocking functions, such as setOwner or execute, which use the modifier.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check for the newModuleManager address to not be zero and revert otherwise.

### Unchecked possible zero address

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Proxy.sol, at line 7 inside the constructor the impl parameter can be zero and is not checked. In case the address is zero, the proxy would not function properly and there is no fallback method to set the correct implementation after deployment.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check for the to address variable to not be zero and revert otherwise.

### Improper transfer of ownership

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Identity.sol, an arbitrary module can change the owner of the contract. This action should be an only owner action.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check in function  _setOwner to ensure that only the owner of the contract can modify the ownership.

## Low Risk

### Pragma version lock

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

It’s recommended to have the same compiler version that the contracts were tested with the most. This way it reduces the risk of introducing unknown bugs. 

**Recommendation**: 

Lock pragma versions.

### Unprotected initialize function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract Identity.sol, at line 31, the initialize function is not protected and therefore anybody can call and initialize the contract with an arbitrary initialOwner address. As the function is blocked after the first call, due to the _isInitialized flag, this essentially locks the contract owner.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a modifier or check to protect the initialize function.

**Comment from client**: 

We don't fix this, because Proxy of Identity needs to be atomically deployed and initialized by an external contract account like IdentityProxyFactory.


### Signature length verification

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


In contract ECDSA, in function recover, from line 26, the length of sig is not validated. A signature should be 65 bytes and any mismatch can result in unclear errors due to use of assembly.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check for sig, to have exactly 65 bytes and revert otherwise.


### Signature length verification

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract ECDSA, in function recover, from line 44, the length of sig is not validated. A signature should be 65 bytes and any mismatch can result in unclear errors due to use of assembly. Taking into account the fact that the sig parameter contains several signatures, its length should be a multiple of 65.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check for length of sig to be a multiple of 65 bytes and revert otherwise.

### Signature index verification

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contract ECDSA, in function recover, from line 44, the index of signature is not validated. For a given index, there must be a signature in the sigs variable. In other words, the value of the index cannot be greater than the length of a signature (65) multiplied by the number of signatures.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check to ensure that exists a signature corresponding to the index and revert otherwise.

## Informational

### Use of assembly for contract creation

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledge

**Description**

In contract Factory.sol, the method create that deploys a new contract uses the opcode create2 in order to create a new contract from the bytecode. In newer Solidity versions, >=8, there is an alternative to this by using the new keyword to deploy a contract. This approach would eliminate the need for inline assembly.

**Recommendation**: 

If the intent is to deploy a single type of contract, of which you have the source code, refactor and use the new keyword.

**Comment from client**: 

we don't fix this, because Factory is intended to deploy arbitrary contracts.


### Unchecked address before assignment

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Identity, in function _setModuleManager, the address of variable _moduleManager is set. This address must be a contract address that implements the IModuleManager interface, but no check is made on it.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check in function _setModuleManager to verify that newModuleManager is a contract address, to prevent un undefined behavior

### Unchecked address before assignment

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract ModuleRegistry, in function registerModule the address of a module is stored. This address must be a contract address.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check in function  “registerModule” to verify that module is a contract address, to prevent un undefined behavior
