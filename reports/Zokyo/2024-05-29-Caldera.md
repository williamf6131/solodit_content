# Findings

## Low Risk

### Lack of challenge order checks in the `verifyChallenge()` function.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

The challenges are intended to be verified in order. But the `verifyChallenge()` function doesn’t check if the challenge to be verified is in the correct order.

**Recommendation**: 

Check if the challenge of the `batchSequenceNumber` which is 1  less than the input sequence number is verified in the `verifyChallenge()` function.

### `firstOpenChallengeForNodeKey()` function returns incorrect value.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

`firstOpenChallengeForNodeKey()` function returns a number greater by 1 than `batchSequenceNumber` of the first challenge including `_nodeKeyId` or just returns the first open challenge.

**Recommendation**: 

Find all the challenges including `_nodeKeyId` and then select the first open challenge among them.


### The lower limit should be `firstBatchSequenceNumber` for loops.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Batch sequence numbers are increased by 1 and the first number is stored with the `firstBatchSequenceNumber` variable.
But in the `firstOpenChallengeForNodeKey()`, `firstOpenChallenge()`, and `firstUnverifiedChallenge()` functions, for loops iterates from the latest sequence number to 0.
If the `firstBatchSequenceNumber` is not 1, then there will be unnecessary iterations.

**Recommendation**: 

In the for loop, the lower limit should be the `firstBatchSequenceNumber`.

### If no challenge is submitted, the `firstOpenChallengeForNodeKey()`, `firstOpenChallenge()`, and `firstUnverifiedChallenge()` functions return incorrect values.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

`challenges[0].closedTimestamp` will always be zero because the sequence number can not be 0.
So if no challenge is submitted, the `firstOpenChallengeForNodeKey()`, `firstOpenChallenge()`, and `firstUnverifiedChallenge()` functions return 1 which is not correct.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the functions like this.
```solidity
    function firstOpenChallenge() public view returns (uint256) {
        if (firstBatchSequenceNumber == 0) return 0;
        uint256 i = latestBatchSequenceNumber;
        for (; i >= firstBatchSequenceNumber; i--) {
            if (challenges[i].closedTimestamp <= block.timestamp) {
                return i + 1;
            }
        }
        if (i == firstBatchSequenceNumber - 1) {
            return firstBatchSequenceNumber;
        }
    }
```

### Centralization risks.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

All critical states could be updated by the owner. If the owner's account got hacked, the attacker can break everything.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a multi-sig wallet with a timelock as the owner.

### Lack of events
	
**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

`L 138, 146, 154, 164, 175, 181, 192, 201`
The setter functions don’t emit events when key states are updated.

**Recommendation**: 

Add events according to the states to be update

### Lack of new minBatchReward value.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

`batchReward`  value is intended to be greater than `minBatchReward` but in the `setMinBatchReward()` function, `minBatchReward` could be set a value greater than the current `batchReward` since there is no check for that.

**Recommendation**: 

Check if the `minBatchReward` value to be set is smaller than the current `batchReward` value.

## Informational

### Incorrect comments.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Referee.sol L168-174
The comments for the function setRewardPerSecond are incorrect . They define the functionality of the function setAssertionInterval instead of setRewardPerSecond.

Referee.sol L189-190
Incorrect comments for the _rewardIncreaseDenominator and _rewardDecreaseDenominator.

**Recommendation**: 

Replace with the correct comments of the input variables.

### Storage variables are read multiple times in the functions.
	
**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

	Raferee.sol L111-112: rewardPerSecond variable
	Raferee.sol L241-264: batchReward variable
	Raferee.sol L231, L259: rewardPerSecond variable
	Raferee.sol L272, 276, 279: currentStartIndex variable
	Raferee.sol L325: _nodeKeyIds.length could be cached with a local variable.
	Raferee.sol L363-364: challenges[_batchSequenceNumber].closedTimestamp

In the above lines, they could be optimized.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a local variable instead of reading a storage multiple times.

### Duplicated for loops.
	
**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Raferee.sol L367, 372
In the `verifyChallenge()` function, there are 2 loops with the same condition.

**Recommendation**: 

Combine the loops into one.

### Floating Pragma

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Description**

The contract uses a floating pragma →
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
```

It allows to compile contracts with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.
