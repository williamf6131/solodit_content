# Findings

## High Risk

### Possibility of Reentrance via vote()

**Severity**: High

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The vote() function of the PendleVoteManagerMainChain contract is vulnerable to a reentrance attack. This is because the _updateVoteAndCheck() function makes an external call via stakeFor() and withdrawFor() functions. This attack can be carried out if the bribe contract is a malicious contract.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to follow the checks effects interactions pattern by making all the state variable changes after the stakeFor() and withdrawFor() function calls. Alternatively, a reentrance guard can be added for the same.

**Comments**: The client added a nonReentrant modifier for vote() and castVotes(). The bribePool was removed and not used anymore

## Medium Risk

### Incorrect use of modifier

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The _claimRewardFor() function in PendleVoteManagerBaseUpg contract, calls the getReward() function of the BribeRewardPool. But the getReward() is an onlyMasterPenPie function, which means that only masterPenPie contract can call it. This will result in all the _claimRewardFor() calls to fail in production.

**Recommendation**: 

The current code does not allow two different contracts(masterPenPie and PendleVoteManager) to call the getReward() function of the BribeRewardPool contract. Consider either adding two operators in the modifier of the getReward() function, or reviewing the business and operational logic.

**Comments**: The claim functions were moved to PenpieBribeRewardDistributor with different codes and logic.


### Centralization risks in vlPenpie

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The vlPenpie can be paused anytime by an admin using pause(). This can be exploited by a malicious admin to deny service to users. 
Also, the token can be upgraded anytime to change its behavior. This can be exploited by a malicious admin to introduce a malicious piece of code that can result in loss of funds.
The setPendleVoteManager() can be used by a malicious admin to change the pendleVoteManager. This can result in a Denial of Service, as the startUnlock will fail to work due to the if statement on line: 274.
Similarly, setMasterChief()  can be used by a malicious admin to change the masterPenPie. This can result in Denial of Service as the users will not be able to call unlock() or forceUnlock() leading to stuck funds. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to use a multisig wallet  in order to decentralize the use of this function between trusted participants.

**Comments**: 

The client said that they would be utilising a multisig in order to mitigate this issue.



### Denial of Service via setCoolDownInSecs()

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The setCoolDownInSecs() function can be used to change the coolDownInSecs variable to a very large value. This can be unfair, especially for the participants who had already locked their tokens and were expecting a different cooldown value. For example, let’s a user A locks his tokens at a time when the cooldown was T1. Assume that the owner changes the coolDownInSecs to T2. Now, when the user A tries to unlock his tokens, cooldown T1 should be applied for his token’s unlock and not T2. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to do the following to mitigate this issue:
A) Add an upper limit to the coolDownInSecs to be set via setCoolDownInSecs(). 
B) Add require checks to ensure that the above scenario is mitigated as described in the above example.
C) Use a multisig wallet to decentralize the usage of setCoolDownInSecs() between trusted participants.

**Comments**: The client said that they would be utilising a multisig in order to mitigate this issue.


### Lock more in order to Unlock

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

If the users locked their tokens at say time T1. And the pendleVoteManager was set after T1. Then users will need to lock more Penpie in the contract if they want to call startUnlock() on their previous tokens. Thus, it can be unfair for the users who had locked their tokens before the setting of pendleVoteManager.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to let only users who have locked their tokens in the vlPenpie contract after time T1 to follow the condition on line: 274 which leads to revert. This could require rewriting of the if statement accordingly to make the fix.

**Comments**: The client said that voted vlPNP can not be startUnlocked, so if users did not vote with their vlPNP after PendleVoterManager is set, they should still be able to startUnlock.


### Centralization risks in PendleVoteManager

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The excessive authority granted to the admin poses a vulnerability in the contracts. The central issue is that the admin has unrestricted access to critical functions such as setRemoteDelegate() and general setters/mutators. 

Also, the function removePool() can be used to disable the pool at anytime. A malicious admin can exploit this to manipulate the outcome of voting results, such as by disabling the pool before the expected time when the pool was supposed to be disabled.

This concentration of power raises concerns, especially when certain functions carry higher risks than others. Depending on the project's objectives, it is advisable to implement governance mechanisms or utilize multisig wallets to distribute control and mitigate potential risks associated with a single wallet's authority.

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to use a multisig wallet  in order to decentralize the use of this function between trusted participants. Additionally, a secure governance mechanism can be implemented for the same.

**Comments**: The client said that they would be utilising a multisig in order to mitigate this issue.

### Unsafe Uint64 Casting in PendleVoteManager

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

 In _getVoteInPercentage() function:
 ```solidity
169  else {
170    votePerc = exactVoteCount * 100 / totalVotes();
171    pendleVote = uint64(_getExactPercentage(votePerc));
172  }

And
161     exactVoteCount = uint256(_vote) + _currentVote;
162     votePerc = exactVoteCount * 100 / totalVotes();
163     pendleVote = uint64(_getExactPercentage(votePerc));
```
_getExactPercentage() function returns uint256 and it is being casted to uint64 without validating that the input number is less than or equal to type(uint64).max. The input number needs to be as low as 1845 in order to provoke this casting.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a safe casting function that validates input is less than type(uint64).max

**Fix**:  In commit 60e393d, the function is no longer implemented, making the issue irrelevant.

## Low Risk

### Renounce Ownership

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The renounceOwnership() function of the Ownable contract, which is inherited by VLPenPie, can be called accidentally by the admin leading to the immediate renouncement of ownership to zero address after which any onlyOwner functions will not be callable which can be risky.

**Remediation**:

It is advised that the Owner cannot call renounceOwnership() without first transferring ownership to a  different address. Additionally, if a multi-signature wallet is utilized, executing the renounceOwnership() method for two or more users should be confirmed. Alternatively, the Renounce Ownership functionality can be disabled by overriding it.

**Comments**: The client said that they would be utilizing a multisig in order to mitigate this issue.

### Transfer Ownership

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

The transferOwnership() function of the Ownable contract, which is inherited by VLPenPie, allows the current admin to transfer his privileges to another address. However, inside transferOwnership(), the newOwner is directly stored
into the storage owner, after validating the newOwner is a non-zero address, and immediately overwrites the current owner. This can lead to cases where the admin has transferred ownership to an incorrect address and wants to revoke the transfer of ownership, or in the cases where the current admin comes to know that the new admin has lost access to his account.

**Remediation**:

It is advised to make ownership transfer a two-step process.
**Refer**- 
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol 
and https://github.com/razzorsec/RazzorSec-Contracts/blob/main/AccessControl/SafeOwn.sol  

### Unprotected initializer could be called by anyone

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The Initializable library is used by vlPenPie. To prevent leaving an implementation contract uninitialized, it is recommended to add the _disableInitializers() function in the constructor to lock the contracts automatically during the deployment.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider locking the implementation contract by invoking _disableInitializers() function.

**Refer**- https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#initializing_the_implementation_contract 

### Missing zero address checks

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The _penPie parameter in __vlPenPie_init_() of the vlPenpie contract, has a missing zero address check. Due to this a zero address can be passed accidentally to the parameter to set _penpie as a zero address.
Also the lockFor() function has a missing zero address check.This can lead to funds being locked for the "For" address which is zero address, resulting in lock of funds forever.

**Remediation**:

It is advised to add a zero address check because PenPie address can not be changed to another address once it is set, although upgrading the contract with new parameters is entirely possible.

### Missing Reentrance init call

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

Missing call to __ReentrancyGuard_init() in the __vlPenPie_init_() function. Although it is expected that the nonReentrant modifier will work in either case, it would be a good security practice that the Reentrance Guard variables are initialized to avoid confusion and unintended issues.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add a call to  __ReentrancyGuard_init() in the __vlPenPie_init_() function.

### For loop over dynamic array

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

If the size of poolInfos is too large, then getClaimReward() might run out of gas resulting in a Denial of Service. 

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to restrict the maximum size of the pool.
 
### Missing forwarding of rewards

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

In the harvestSinglePool() function, no rewards are forwarded using _forwardRewards(). This is inconsistent with the getClaimReward() function, which is similar but forwards the rewards after harvest using _forwardRewards(). This could result in the rewards only being approved and not being transferred by the contract. This may result in stuck funds if the msg.sender for the harvestSinglePool() is a smart contract because it might be unable to call transferFrom due to its lack of usage of transferFrom. 

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to add _forwardRewards() at the end of harvestSinglePool() function and check business and operational logic.

**Comment**: The function was harvestSinglePool() was removed in the fixed version of the contract by the client.


### Returned boolean value ignored

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The _claimRewardFor() ignores the return value by getReward() function, which is a boolean value. 

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to also return the boolean value or add a requirement check on the boolean value returned.

**Comments**: The _claimRewardFor() was removed in the latest fixes and code logic by the client

### Possibility of out of gas in castVotes

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

The castVotes() function has external calls inside a for loop in the form of voter.getUserPoolVote()  and vePendle.balanceOf(). This can result in a Denial of Service if there are a lot of pools to iterate over. 

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to add a limit on the maximum number of pools in order to avoid this issue.


### Discarded Votes due to unsuitable datatype

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

In _updateVoteAndCheck() function of the PendleVoteManagerBaseUpg contract, the weights of votes add up as follows:
```solidity
263  uint256 absVal = uint256(-weight);
264  pool.totalVoteInVlPenPie -= absVal;
265  userVotedForPoolInVlPenPie[_user][pool.market] -= absVal;
```
This is given weight < 0 , while we have pool.totalVoteInVlPenPie of type uint256 and userVotedForPoolInVlPenPie maps to a uint256 also. These arithmetic operations revert when userVotedForPoolInVlPenPie and pool.totalVoteInVlPenPie are smaller than absVal.
Suppose the following scenario:
User A sends vote with weight 20
User B sends vote with weight -10 

At the beginning at zero total votes, we have User A sending a positive vote and User B sends a negative vote then we end up with total votes = 20 - 10 = 10. In another alternative scenario User A notices the vote of User B in the transaction pool, then he tunes the gas fee so that User B has his call mined first. In that case, total votes are 20 because User B fails to get his vote counted.
The issue arises because of the uint256 type of pool.totalVoteInVlPenPie and userVotedForPoolInVlPenPie which does not suit the way vote is counted.


**Recommendation**:

It is advised to add a limit on the maximum number of pools in order to avoid this issue.

### Returned UserPoolData from external call is not validated

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

PendleVoteManagerMainChain.sol - In getVoteForMarket() function, the userPoolData return is not validated to be actually existent. An invalid address of market might be entered which returns a zero value by default. The result of the calculation is zero in this case, and it is not clear if the zero is a result of a valid calculation, or it is just due to an invalid market input.
```solidity
75  function getVoteForMarket(address market) public view returns (uint256) {
76      IPVoteController.UserPoolData memory userPoolData = voter
77          .getUserPoolVote(address(pendleStaking), market);
78      uint256 poolVote = userPoolData.weight * totalVotes() / 1e18 ;
79      return poolVote;
80  }
```
**Recommendation**:

Short term, add a require statement to validate the attributes of userPoolData to be non-zero value.

### Init function call missing

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

__Pausable_init() is not called in the new version of PendleVoteManagerBaseUpg contract.

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to call the appropriate init function in the contract.


## Informational

### Incorrect usage of sign

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The _maxSlots in __vlPenPie_init_() of the vlPenPie contract can never be negative as it is an unsigned integer.
Similarly, the  _coolDownSecs can never be negative as it is also an unsigned integer..

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to remove the < sign as it is not required.


### Incorrect Natspec comments

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The Natspec comments above the startUnlock() function describe 3 parameters that do not exist in this function.

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to write Natspec correct comments with describing the correct parameters existing in the function. 


### Unused modifier

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The PendleVoteManagerBaseUpg contract has modifier refundUnusedEth() which is not being used anywhere.

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to remove the unused modifier.

**Comments**: 

The client has said that they would be removing it in the fixes.


### Missing events for critical functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

Critical functions like setMainChainId(), setRemoteDelegate(), and setMinRemoteCastGas() in PendleVoteManager contracts do not emit an event. The same goes for setPendleVoteManager() in VLPenpie contract.
Emitting events is a best practice for offchain monitoring.

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to emit appropriate events for the above mentioned events.

**Fix**:  In commit 60e393d, the issue is partially resolved, as of this last commit, setPendleVoteManager() does not emit the relevant events.


### Unnecessary redundant initialization of variables

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

PendleVoteManagerMainChain.sol/PendleVoteManagerSideChain.sol - In __PendleVoteManagerMainChain_init()/__PendleVoteManagerSideChain_init() functions which are invoked in order to initialize the state of the contracts. There exist a repeated initialization of two state variables:
pendleStaking = _pendleStaking;
vlPenPie = _vlPenPie;

These variables are initialized already by the base contract on calling __PendleVoteManagerBaseUpg_init() function, which is the base of each of the two contracts.

**Recommendation**:

No need for pendleStaking and vlPenPie value assignment, therefore better to be removed from the body of the initializer functions.

**Fix**:  Issue addressed at commit  60e393d



### Lock Solidity

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

Lock the pragma to a specific version, since not all the EVM compiler versions support all the features, especially the latest one’s which are kind of beta versions, So the intended behavior written in code might not be executed as expected. Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, the latest compiler which may have higher risks of undiscovered bugs.

**Recommendation**:

Fix the pragma version of each contract.

**Fix**:  Fixed at version 0.8.19


### Follow checks-effects-interactions pattern

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

 As a best practice it is recommended to follow checks-effects-interactions pattern whenever it is possible. Worth noting to point out snippets of vlPenpie contract in which this pattern is broken.
In _unlock() function we have interaction with masterPenPie preceding the effects of updating the values of totalAmountInCoolDown and totalAmount.
IMasterPenpie(masterPenPie).withdrawVlPenPieFor(_unlockedAmount, msg.sender); 
totalAmountInCoolDown -= _unlockedAmount;
totalAmount -= _unlockedAmount;

In _lock() function we have interaction with penPie preceding the effects of updating the value of totalAmount.
penPie.safeTransferFrom(spender, address(this), _amount);
IMasterPenpie(masterPenPie).depositVlPenPieFor(_amount, _for);
totalAmount += _amount; 

In transferPenalty() function, interaction with penPie precedes the update of the value of totalPenalty.
IERC20(penPie).safeTransfer(penaltyDestination, totalPenalty);
emit PenaltySentTo(penaltyDestination, totalPenalty);
totalPenalty = 0;


**Recommendation**:

Move the interaction line of codes after the effects.

**Fix**:  Not possible to change as it will affect  function’s intended behavior demanded by the client.


### Declaration of gap variable

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In PendleVoteManagerBaseUpg, the gap variable is declared before the state variables which is contrary to the Openzeppelin convention of declaring gap variables after the state variables.

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to follow Openzeppelin standard of declaring gap variables at the end of all the state variables as a good security practice. 
**Refer**- https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#storage-gaps
