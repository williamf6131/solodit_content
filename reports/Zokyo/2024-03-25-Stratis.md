## Low Risk

### Possible loss of rewards due to precision loss

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In `MasternodeStakingContract.sol`, the method claim rewards calculate the total dividends as follows:
```solidity
if (totalRegistrations > 0) {
           // All categories of registered accounts are treated as having identical 'staking' amounts for the purposes of dividing up the rewards.
           totalDividends += (amount / totalRegistrations);            lastBalance += amount;
       }
```
Here, there is a `wei` loss of rewards funds due to automatic truncation in the solidity division.

Although a small amount, if repeated multiple times whenever there is a registration, claim rewards, or withdrawal, it will break the invariant that total rewards claimed by users equals the total reward sent to the contract.

**PoC:**
```solidity
function test_precisionLoss() public {
       // user 1
       registerALegacyAccount();


       // 31 ether as rewards
       vm.deal(
           address(stakingContract),
           address(stakingContract).balance + 31 ether
       );


       // user 2
       registerANonLegacyAccount();


       // 31 ether as rewards
       vm.deal(
           address(stakingContract),
           address(stakingContract).balance + 31 ether
       );


       // user 3
       address user3 = makeAddr("user3");
       vm.deal(user3, 1_000_000 ether);
       vm.startPrank(user3);
       stakingContract.register{value: 1_000_000 ether}();


       // 31 ether as rewards
       vm.deal(
           address(stakingContract),
           address(stakingContract).balance + 31 ether
       );


       vm.stopPrank();


       uint256 user1BalanceBeforeClaimingRewards = user.balance;
       uint256 user2BalanceBeforeClaimingRewards = legacyAccounts[0].balance;
       uint256 user3BalanceBeforeClaimingRewards = user3.balance;


       vm.prank(user);
       stakingContract.claimRewards();


       vm.prank(legacyAccounts[0]);
       stakingContract.claimRewards();


       vm.prank(user3);
       stakingContract.claimRewards();


       uint256 user1BalanceAfterClaimingRewards = user.balance;
       uint256 user2BalanceAfterClaimingRewards = legacyAccounts[0].balance;
       uint256 user3BalanceAfterClaimingRewards = user3.balance;


       uint totalRewardsClaimedByUsers = user1BalanceAfterClaimingRewards -
           user1BalanceBeforeClaimingRewards +
           user2BalanceAfterClaimingRewards -
           user2BalanceBeforeClaimingRewards +
           user3BalanceAfterClaimingRewards -
           user3BalanceBeforeClaimingRewards;


       assertEq(totalRewardsClaimedByUsers, 93 ether);
   }
```

**Result:**
```
├─ emit log(val: "Error: a == b not satisfied [uint]")
    ├─ emit log_named_uint(key: "      Left", val: 92999999999999999999 [9.299e19])
    ├─ emit log_named_uint(key: "     Right", val: 93000000000000000000 [9.3e19])
```
We can see that 1 wei is not sent as a reward to users.


**Recommendation: **

Update the total dividend calculation logic to make this precision loss as low as possible. One of the suggested methods is pointMultiplier as mentioned here under the subtopic `rounding errors`.

## Informational

### Use OpenZeppelin’s nonReentrant modifier

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

In MasternodeStakingContract.sol, some methods send native tokens to addresses that are not trusted. Although the CEI pattern is followed, it is advised to use OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard as well to ensure more safety.

**Recommendation:** 

Use nonreentrant modifier on `claimRewards(...)` and `completeWithdrawal(...)` method.

### Accounts’ left reward balance after claim will always be 0 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**


In MasternodeStakingContract.sol, the method claimRewards has the following logic:
```solidity
       uint256 claimAmount = accounts[msg.sender].balance;


       accounts[msg.sender].lastClaimedBlock = block.number; 
       if (claimAmount == 0) {
           return;
       }
       accounts[msg.sender].balance -= claimAmount;
 ```
Here claimAmout is exactly equal to balance but later on, balance is not directly not set 0.

**Recommendation**: 

To save gas, updated as follows:
```solidity
accounts[msg.sender].balance -= claimAmount;
```
 With
 ```solidity
accounts[msg.sender].balance = 0;
```

### Variable `withdrawingCollateralAmount` is not necessary

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**


In MasternodeStakingContract.sol, the method startWithdrawal initiates a withdrawal and updates the following states:
```solidity
withdrawingCollateralAmount += applicableCollateral;       totalCollateralAmount -= applicableCollateral;
```


Here, these 2 arithmetic operations are not required because:

When new rewards are added, they will still be accounted correctly as (`contract total balance - lastBalance - totalCollateralAmount - registrationOfffset`) will be able to handle it. 

**Recommendation**: 

State variable `withdrawingCollateralAmount` can be avoided as state balance can still be managed if it is not explicitly required to check how much balance is currently going to be withdrawn.

### No fixed solidity version

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

MasternodeStakingContract use the following floating pragma:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
```
It allows to compile contracts with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.


### Missing events for critical functions 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

In the MasternodeStakingContract.sol, there are missing events for critical functions which contain important state changes such as `completeWithdrawal()` and `claimRewards()`. 

Similarly, in the Distribution.sol, there are missing events for the `claim()` function. Emitting events is the best practice secuirtywise as it helps track the system offchain.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add proper events for the same.
