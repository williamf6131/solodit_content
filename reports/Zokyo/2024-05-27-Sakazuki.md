# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Potential for Stale or Incorrect Price Data from Chainlink Oracles

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The `SakazukiSilver` smart contract utilizes Chainlink oracles to obtain real-time exchange rates for ETH/USD and JPY/USD, which are crucial for calculating the dynamic minting prices of NFTs. However, there is a significant risk associated with the potential of receiving stale or incorrect data from Chainlink oracles. This can happen due to delays in starting new rounds, consensus issues among Chainlink nodes, network congestion, or vulnerabilities/attacks on the Chainlink system. Using outdated or incorrect data for price calculation could lead to improper NFT pricing, either overvaluing or undervaluing the minted NFTs, which impacts the financial integrity and user confidence in the platform.

**Recommendation**

Implement immediate validation checks within the smart contract when fetching the latest round data from Chainlink oracles. Example checks include:
```solidity
(uint80 roundID, int price, , uint256 updateTime, uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(oracleAddress).latestRoundData();
require(price > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round");
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
```
These checks ensure that the price is positive, the round of data is complete, and the data is not stale.

### Overprivileged Owner Functions

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

The contract allows the owner to perform critical operations such as changing the maximum supply, minting price, and base URI. These functions are central to the contract's integrity and can significantly impact all users if misused. The potential for malicious or accidental misuse increases due to the lack of constraints on these operations beyond ownership verification.

**Scenario**: A compromised owner account could lead to drastic changes in the contract's behavior, such as inflating the supply or changing financial parameters, potentially devaluing the NFTs or disrupting the market.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a multi-sig requirement for sensitive operations to ensure checks and balances. Additionally, consider using a timelock for critical changes, providing users a window to react to changes or exit if they disagree with the direction of the project.

### Potential for Signature Malleability

Severity: Medium

Status: Resolved

**Description**: 

The contract utilizes Ethereum's ecrecover function to verify that a given message was signed by the holder of the private keys of a specified address. This approach, while standard, is susceptible to ECDSA signature malleability issues. This is because Ethereum signatures (comprised of r, s, v components) are not strictly unique, and it is theoretically possible to manipulate a signature to produce a valid variant without access to the corresponding private key. This could potentially be exploited under certain conditions to bypass signature verifications if additional safeguards are not in place.

**Scenario**:

**Signature Manipulation**: 

An attacker could potentially manipulate an intercepted signature to create another valid signature that the ecrecover function would still deem correct. This manipulated signature could then be used to perform operations or access rights reserved for the original signer, leading to unauthorized actions.

**Recommendations**:

it is recommended to use a more comprehensive signature verification library, such as OpenZeppelinâ€™s ECDSA library. This library includes functions that normalize signature components and verify their correctness beyond what ecrecover provides, reducing the risk of malleability. 

### Overpayment not Returned in mint Function

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

In the `mint()` function of the Solidity smart contract, users can potentially pay more than the required minting price. However, the function does not handle this overpayment scenario and the excess amount is not returned to the user. This could lead to loss of funds for the user.

**Recommendation**

Modify the `mint()` function to calculate the exact minting cost and return any excess payment to the user.

## Low Risk

### Loss of minting price information in mint Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

In the `mint()` function of the Solidity smart contract, the minting price information is not stored or returned after the minting price is calculated and assigned to `_amountInEth`. This means that users do not have an easy way to know at what price they minted the new tokens. This lack of transparency can lead to confusion and potential disputes.

**Recommendation** 

Modify the mint function to store the result of the minting price calculated which is already taking place in `_amountInEth`. Then, include this variable in the WithdrawalSuccess event or create a new event that emits this information. This way, users can track the minting price for each transaction. Here's a sample implementation:
```solidity
	...
    emit WithdrawalSuccess(msg.value, _amountInEth);
```

## Informational

### Unnecessary use of nonReentrant modifier in privileged functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

In the smart contract Sakazuki, the `nonReentrant` modifier is used with most of the privileged functions (those with `onlyOwner`). However, these functions are not actually reentrant, meaning they don't make external calls that could potentially call back into the contract before the functions are finished. The unnecessary use of nonReentrant increases gas costs and adds complexity to the contract.

**Recommendation** 

Remove the `nonReentrant` modifier from the privileged functions where it is not needed.

### Lack of Event Emissions in Privileged Functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The privileged functions in the Solidity smart contract, which are only callable by the owner, do not emit events when they are called. This lack of event emissions makes it difficult to track changes and actions performed by the owner, reducing transparency.
```solidity
	function setETH2USDAggregator(address eth2usd) external 
	function setJPY2USDAggregator(address jpy2usd) external 
	function setOpen(bool _open) external 
	function setSigner(address _signer) external 
	function setTokenURI(uint256 id, string memory newURI) external
```

**Recommendation** 

Implement event emissions in each of the privileged functions to track changes made by the owner. This will improve the transparency and traceability of the contract. 
**Fix** - This issue is addressed on commit ce7b70a. Events are emitted in all the mentioned functions except for setTokenURI 


### Misleading Error Message in mint Function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

In the mint function of the Solidity smart contract, the error message in the `require(success, "Transfer could be completed");` statement is misleading. The message suggests that the transfer was successful, even though this require statement is meant to throw an error when the transfer fails.

**Recommendation** 

Change the error message to accurately reflect the error condition. The message should indicate that the transfer could not be completed. Here's the corrected code:
```solidity
(bool success, ) = payable(payoutAddress).call{ value: msg.value }("");
require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
```

### Use of unbounded solidity version in pragma directive

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

In the smart contract, the pragma directive pragma solidity >=0.8.12; is used to specify the compiler version. This directive allows any compiler version greater than or equal to 0.8.12. However, this could potentially lead to issues if the contract is compiled with a future version of Solidity that introduces breaking changes.

**Recommendation** 

Specify the compiler version that you have tested and know your contract works with. This can help prevent potential issues caused by compiler changes in future versions.

### Redundant noZeroAddress Modifier Usage

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The SakazukiSilver smart contract employs a `noZeroAddress` modifier to prevent zero addresses from being used in critical functions. However, this modifier is redundantly applied in two specific instances where checks are already in place, leading to unnecessary gas consumption and code complexity.

**Redundancy in `mint` Function**:
The mint function includes the `noZeroAddress(payoutAddress)` modifier to ensure that the `payoutAddress` is not zero. However, the `setPayoutAddress` function, which is the only method to set `payoutAddress`, already employs this modifier. Since `payoutAddress` can only be set through `setPayoutAddress`, the check in `mint` is redundant.

**Redundancy in `Constructor` for `_signer`**:

The constructor of the contract uses the `noZeroAddress(_signer)` modifier to validate that the `_signer` address is not zero. Additionally, there is an explicit check within the constructor (`require(_signer != address(0), "Invalid signer address")`). This results in the same validation being performed twice.

**Recommendations**:

**For the mint function**: Remove the `noZeroAddress(payoutAddress)` modifier. Since `payoutAddress` is set and checked in setPayoutAddress, it is guaranteed not to be zero when mint is called, assuming no direct state manipulation (which is protected against by Solidity's encapsulation).

**For the Constructor**: Remove the `noZeroAddress(_signer)` modifier and rely on the explicit require statement already in place to check that _signer is not zero. This maintains the intended functionality without redundancy.
