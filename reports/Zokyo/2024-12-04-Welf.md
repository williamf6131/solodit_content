# Findings

## High Risk

###  Missing _vestingCount Increment

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The _vestingCount variable is not incremented after being used to assign an index in the addUserVesting function of ERC20Vesting. This results in vestings being assigned the same index, leading to inconsistent and corrupted mappings.
Additionally, addUserVesting function assigns the index for the new vesting to _vestingCount without incrementing it. This could lead to overwriting the most recently added vesting entry.

**Recommendation**:

Increment _vestingCount and set index to _vestingCount + 1 to ensure a unique index is used for the new vesting.


### Incorrect Vesting Amount Comparison

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the updateUserVesting function of ERC20Vesting, the condition if(user.claimedAmount < newAmount) is incorrect. This condition erroneously checks if the claimedAmount is less than newAmount. The intended logic should verify that the claimedAmount does not exceed the newAmount. Using the wrong comparison allows reducing the vesting amount below what has already been claimed, potentially resulting in an underflow condition when calculating the claim amount and it will always revert.

**Recommendation**:

Update the condition to if(user.claimedAmount > newAmount) revert()  to correctly enforce that the new vesting amount must be greater than or equal to the already claimed amount.

## Medium Risk

### TGE Date Update Affects Previous Vestings

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The setTgeDate function of ERC20Vesting updates the tgeStartDate each time it is called. However, this update applies to all vesting schedules, including previous ones, potentially causing confusion or lack of transparency for users.

**Recommendation**:

Cache the tgeStartDate for each vesting schedule rather than updating the global tgeStartDate each time. This will ensure transparency for users and provide a clear reference to the TGE date used at the time of their vesting. Consider storing the TGE date in the vesting mapping (_vestingMap) for each user.

## Low Risk

### Excessive Loops Around the Codebase

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

There are multiple instances of loops in the codebase that iterate over potentially large datasets, E.g. insertVestingList, insertWalletListToVesting, removeWalletListFromVesting, insertAdminList, removeAdminList. Excessive use of loops can lead to high gas costs and inefficient execution, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. This can result in performance issues and may even cause transactions to fail due to gas limit exceedance.

**Recommendation**:

Optimize loops by reducing their frequency and considering alternative methods.

### Incorrect Comparison for Offset Validation

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the airdrop function of ERC20Vesting, the check if(offset > _vestingCount) is used to ensure the offset is within bounds. However, it should be if(offset >= _vestingCount) because if the offset is equal to _vestingCount, the index will be zero.
```solidity
492:     function airdrop(uint256 batchSize, uint256 offset) external onlyPlatformAdmin {
493:         if(offset > _vestingCount)
494:             revert OutOfBounds();
495: 
496:         uint256 index = _vestingCount - offset;
```

**Recommendation**:

Update the comparison to if(offset >= _vestingCount) to ensure the correct behavior when the offset is equal to _vestingCount.


### Unused ReentrancyGuard Import

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The ERC20Vesting.sol and ERC20FixedSupply.sol contract imports ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin, but it is not utilized anywhere in the contract. This could indicate unnecessary code and an unused import, potentially increasing the contract's size without providing any security benefits.

**Recommendation**:

Apply the nonReentrant modifier to the relevant functions. 

## Informational

### Unnecessary Use of SafeMath

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


The ERC20Vesting contract imports SafeMath from the OpenZeppelin library, but in Solidity 0.8.0 and later, arithmetic operations are checked for overflow and underflow by default. Using SafeMath is redundant and not necessary, as the compiler automatically handles these checks.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the SafeMath import and refactor the contract to remove any reliance on it, as Solidity 0.8+ provides built-in overflow and underflow checks.



### Unused event

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The ERC20Vesting.sol contract declares the IncreaseLiquidity event but the vent is not used in the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the unused event.



### Could use delete keyword

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The removeWalletListFromVesting() function of ERC20Vesting is intended to remove the user's vestings by setting each element of _vestingToUser[vestingId] to the default value.
However, it could use the “delete” keyword to remove the entire struct storage instead of setting each element to the default value.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider using the “delete” keyword like “delete _vestingToUser[vestingId]”.
 
### Risk of Centralisation

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The current implementation grants significant control to the owner through multiple functions that can alter the contract's state and behavior. This centralization places considerable trust in a single entity, increasing the risk of potential misuse.
If the owner's private key is compromised, an attacker could execute any function accessible to the owner, potentially leading to fund loss, contract manipulation, or service disruption.

**Recommendation**: 

To enhance security and reduce the risk of a single point of failure, it is recommended to implement a multi-signature wallet for executing owner functions.

**Client Comment**: As with propchain it is planned to use Fireblocks SaaS solution to distribute key-shards between multiple management and operational members. Their approval is mandatory and configured in the company’s workspace. Transactions can therefore only be signed after all necessary team members have reviewed and approved a transaction via their defined company devices.
