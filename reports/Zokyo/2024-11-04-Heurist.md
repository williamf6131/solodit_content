## High Risk

### ExchangeRate manipulation via Donation 

**Severity** : High 

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The StHEU.sol  donate(uint256 amount) function allows the contract owner to donate HEU tokens to the contract. The donated tokens increase the totalHEU balance, which affects the exchange rate.

**Manipulation Scenario**:

The contract owner (or someone with control over the owner account) could donate a large number of HEU tokens to the contract, thereby increasing totalHEU and boosting the exchange rate.
With the exchange rate now inflated, the owner could claim previously vested stHEU tokens, receiving more HEU tokens than the value of the stHEU that was originally vested.
Since the donate() function can only be called by the owner, there is a centralization risk where the owner could manipulate the exchange rate to their benefit.

**Recommendation **

Restrict the donate() function to only allow donations when migrationMode is active, to avoid affecting the exchange rate during normal operations.

**Comment**: 

The donate() function has been removed from the contract.


### Vesting During Migration Mode

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The StHEU.sol vest() function does not check if migrationMode is enabled, allowing users to continue vesting stHEU tokens even when the contract is in migration mode.
 A malicious user could vest stHEU tokens during migration, potentially leading to inconsistencies during migration. For instance, the system may not accurately account for these new vests, leading to errors or a loss of stHEU or HEU.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a require(!migrationMode, "Migration mode active"); check in the vest() function to prevent new vests during migration.

## Medium Risk

### Exchange Rate Manipulation via Direct Transfers

**Severity** : Medium 

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the StHEU the _exchangeRate() calculation relies on the balance of HEU tokens held by the contract (totalHEU). The contract does not differentiate between HEU tokens locked through the lock() function and tokens directly sent to the contract address.
Exchange Rate = totalHEU x le18 / totalSupply

**Manipulation Scenario:**

An attacker could directly send HEU tokens to the contract address without calling the lock() function.
This would increase totalHEU while totalSupply of stHEU remains unchanged, leading to a higher exchange rate.
A higher exchange rate means that future users calling lock() will receive fewer stHEU tokens for the same amount of HEU.
Conversely, an attacker could artificially inflate the HEU balance before calling claim(), allowing them to receive more HEU for their stHEU tokens than they otherwise would have

**Recommendation :  **

Maintain an internal variable (totalLockedHEU) that tracks HEU locked through the lock() function, rather than relying on heu.balanceOf(address(this)). Use totalLockedHEU in the _exchangeRate() calculation to accurately reflect only the HEU that has been locked by users.

**Client comment**: 

The HEU balance in StHEU contract should be always equal or lager than stHEU total supply, and we expected exchange rate to be updated whenever there is HEU transfer to stHEU contract. And the Donate is unnecessary, so this function is removed from the latest contract.
The hypothetical "attacker" won't extract values from such a manipulation and if such a manipulation wouldn't cause financial loss to the protocol (or stakers).




### Zero HEU Payouts Due to Rounding in Exchange Rate Calculation

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The exchange rate calculation in the StHEU contract is performed using the following formula:
return totalHEU * 1e18 / totalSupply;
This formula introduces a critical issue when the totalSupply of stHEU tokens is greater than the totalHEU balance in the contract. Due to Solidity’s truncating division (which rounds down), small discrepancies between totalHEU and totalSupply can result in the exchange rate being rounded down to zero. In such cases, users attempting to claim their HEU tokens may receive zero HEU, even though they are entitled to a portion of the remaining balance.
For example, if totalHEU is 1 and totalSupply is greater than 1, the exchange rate will be calculated as zero due to rounding, effectively denying users any HEU on claims.

**Recommendation**: 

To mitigate this issue, ensure that the exchange rate calculation accounts for rounding and provides users with at least a proportional share of the HEU balance, even when the supply of stHEU tokens is greater than the contract’s HEU balance. A potential solution could involve implementing a minimum exchange rate to avoid rounding down to zero

**Client comment**: 

The HEU balance in StHEU contract should be always equal or lager than stHEU total supply, and we expected exchange rate to be updated whenever there is HEU transfer to stHEU contract. And the Donate is unecessary, so this function is removed from the latest contract.
If totalSupply of stHEU will not exceed totalHEU, and that means this issue won't happen.




### Missing Upper Bound on vestPeriod

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the StHEU contract, the setVestPeriod function allows the contract owner to update the vesting period via setVestPeriod
While the function ensures that newPeriod is non-zero, there is no upper bound on the value that can be set for the vesting period. This lack of an upper bound introduces a centralization risk, where the contract owner could set an unreasonably long vesting period (e.g., 100 years or more), effectively locking users' stHEU tokens indefinitely and preventing them from claiming their HEU tokens.
The absence of an upper limit on the vesting period gives the owner significant control over users' ability to claim tokens. If the owner sets an excessively long vesting period, users may be unable to access their HEU tokens for an extended time, potentially leading to a loss of liquidity and usability.

**Recommendation**: 

Introduce a reasonable upper bound on the vesting period to prevent abuse and ensure that users can eventually claim their tokens.



### Risk of Centralisation

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The current implementation grants significant control to the owner through multiple functions that can alter the contract's state and behavior. This centralization places considerable trust in a single entity, increasing the risk of potential misuse.
If the owner's private key is compromised, an attacker could execute any function accessible to the owner, potentially leading to fund loss, contract manipulation, or service disruption.

**Recommendation**: 

To enhance security and reduce the risk of a single point of failure, it is recommended to implement a multi-signature wallet for executing owner functions. 

**Client comment**: 

For this risk, we will use multi-sig to execute owner functions.

## Low Risk

### Insufficient HEU Tokens for Claims

**Severity** : Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

The claim() function does not validate whether the contract has enough HEU tokens to fulfill a user's claim. If the balance of HEU is insufficient (e.g., due to previous withdrawals or unexpected transfers), the claim could fail.
 Users trying to claim their vested HEU may experience transaction reverts
 
**Recommendation**: 

Add a validation to ensure that the contract holds enough HEU tokens to fulfill the claim:
```solidity
require(heu.balanceOf(address(this)) >= heuAmount, "Insufficient HEU balance in contract to fulfill claim");
```

### Claim During Migration Mode

**Severity** : Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

Users are still able to claim their vested tokens during migration mode, which might not be intended as it can disrupt ongoing migration activities.
 Allowing claims during migration can lead to potential inconsistencies, especially when trying to migrate to a new version of the contract.
 
**Recommendation**: 

Prevent claims during migration mode by adding a validation:
```solidity
require(!migrationMode, "Migration mode active, claiming is disabled");
```

### Missing Validation for Empty Address Inputs (ChestRewards.addRewards() and distribute())

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

In the ChestRewards contract, the addRewards() and distribute() functions do not validate whether the rewardee address is a non-zero address. Adding rewards or distributing them to a zero address will lock the tokens.

**Scenario**: 

The operator accidentally calls addRewards(address(0), 100, RewardType.SILVER), which results in the rewards being assigned to the zero address, effectively locking the tokens and making them unclaimable.

**Recommendation**:

Add a validation check in addRewards(), batchAddRewards(), distribute(), and batchDistribute() to ensure that the rewardee is not a zero address (require(rewardee != address(0), "Invalid rewardee address")).


### Missing Invariant for Consistent Token Balances (ChestRewards.addRewards())

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

In the ChestRewards contract, the addRewards() function does not maintain an invariant to ensure that the total assigned rewards do not exceed the contract balance for silverRewardToken or goldRewardToken. There is no guarantee that sufficient tokens exist in the contract to cover all assigned rewards.

**Scenario**: 

The operator adds rewards without ensuring the corresponding tokens are transferred to the contract, resulting in users being unable to claim their rewards due to insufficient balance.

**Recommendation**: 

Introduce a check during reward addition to ensure that the total rewards assigned are always less than or equal to the contract’s token balance. Alternatively, require operators to deposit the corresponding reward tokens when adding rewards

### Missing Validation for Claiming More than Available Balance (ChestRewards.claimRewards())

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

In the ChestRewards contract, the claimRewards() function does not verify that the contract has enough balance to fulfill the user’s reward claim. The function calls safeTransfer() directly, which may fail if the contract holds insufficient tokens.

**Scenario**: 

Multiple users attempt to claim their rewards, but the contract's balance is insufficient. Users experience transaction failures and incur gas fees without receiving any rewards.

**Recommendation**: 

Before executing safeTransfer(), add a check to ensure the contract holds enough tokens to fulfill the claim (require(goldRewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= rewards, "Not enough tokens to fulfill claim")).

### Lack of Event Emission for Minting

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

In HEU.sol  mint() function does not emit a custom event indicating that new tokens have been minted. While the ERC20 standard emits a Transfer event for minting, adding a custom event would make it easier to track and audit minting operations specifically.

**Scenario**: 

If large minting operations occur, users, auditors, and other stakeholders may have difficulty distinguishing normal token transfers from minting operations without detailed blockchain analysis.

**Recommendation**:

Emit a custom Mint event in the mint() function to improve transparency. This would allow easier monitoring and auditing of minting operations.

### Lack of Two-Step Ownership Transfer 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The contracts does not implement a two-step process for transferring ownership. In its current state, ownership can be transferred in a single step, which can be risky as it could lead to accidental or malicious transfers of ownership without proper verification.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a two-step process for ownership transfer where the new owner must explicitly accept the ownership. It is advisable to use OpenZeppelin’s Ownable2Step.







### Owner can renounce ownership

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Ownable contracts includes a function named renounceOwnership() which can be used to remove the ownership of the contract. 
If this function is called on the StHEU, HEU contract, it will result in the contract becoming disowned. This would subsequently break functions of the token that rely on onlyOwner modifier.



 **Recommendation**: 
 
 override the function to disable its functionality, ensuring the contract cannot be disowned e.g.


### NonReentrant Modifier Not Positioned First

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The nonReentrant modifier should be applied as the first modifier in any function to prevent reentrancy attacks. Placing it after other modifiers may leave the function vulnerable, as external calls or conditions evaluated by earlier modifiers can still be subject to reentrancy exploits.

**Recommendation**:

Reorder the nonReentrant modifier to be the first modifier in all functions where it's applied. 


### Missing Event Emission in setOperator

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The setOperator function in ChestRewards allows the owner to change the operator address:
However, the function does not emit an event to log the change of the operator. Event emissions are crucial for tracking state changes on-chain, providing transparency and facilitating easier auditing of contract activities.

**Recommendation**: 

To improve the contract’s transparency and auditability, it is recommended to emit an event whenever the operator is changed.

## Informational

### Use the proxy pattern at the early stage of the protocol

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

As the protocol evolves, incorporating upgradeability becomes essential for managing potential vulnerabilities, adding new features, and ensuring long-term viability. It is advisable to implement the proxy pattern at the early stage of the protocol, as recommended by ZkSync in their best practices documentation.

**Impact**: 

Utilizing the proxy pattern allows for more flexibility in contract upgrades without losing state or requiring users to migrate to new contracts. This can significantly enhance the governance and adaptability of the protocol as it grows and evolves.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement the proxy pattern early in the development phase. This will enable seamless upgrades and facilitate future enhancements while maintaining user trust and minimizing disruptions. For more details, refer to the ZkSync documentation: ZkSync Best Practices.
