## Medium Risk

###  Possible price manipulation due to dependency on manipulable spot price

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


The ThetaVault contract's _deposit function and the VolatilityToken contract's mintTokens function use a spot price as a fallback mechanism for determining the intrinsic token price when certain conditions are met (e.g., when balance or supply are zero). Specifically:
In _deposit of ThetaVault, the spot price is fetched when the total supply of volToken is zero.
In mintTokens of VolatilityToken, the spot price is fetched when both supply and balance are zero.
This spot price is sourced from a Uniswap V3 pool via the getSpotPrice function in the liquidity manager. If an attacker manipulates this price and then the _deposit or mintTokens function will be triggered under the conditions where the spot price is used (e.g., when supply or balance are zero), they might receive an unfair amount of tokens, or cause other users to receive a suboptimal amount, depending on the functionality.


**Recommendation**: 

Use a TWAP to determine price, as this makes the attack more expensive and difficult to maintain a manipulated price.

**Fix**:
According to protocol’s response:
“Regarding using a spot price when the supply is zero: this doesn't really matter, as when balance is zero, the first mint gets just spot price times the initial amount of UDSC minted of vol tokens. As the first mint is the only owner of vol tokens, it doesn't matter what the sport price is and has no implication on the amount of minted tokens, as the next mint will be made proportionally to the now set supply of vol tokens anyway (i.e. if we just use a constant ratio, this would have been the same, except the ratio is set by spot price).


However, when the balance is 0, this is different. In such a case it does matter, as there are volatility tokens existing in the supply. If that happens, it must mean that the volatility token's position was set to 0, aka got liquidated. This scenario was not properly defended against so we added the following defense: if the volatility token position is liquidated, we do not use the spot price on the next mint, but use a fixed ratio, and we also restrict the mint to a certain max UDSC amount (say 100). This is because this next mint will spread this new worth over all existing supply, causing the minter to lose a lot of value. However, as the amount is forced to be small, this is negligible. So, we both solve the liquidation of vol token position issue, and make sure we do not use the spot price in such a case. Following mints will be proportional as normal.”

### Inconsistent CVI value handling during the deposit in `MegaThetaVault` contract

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `depositForOwner` function in the `MegaThetaVault` contract takes the `_realTimeCVIValue` as a parameter and assigns it to balanceCVIValue. The function then checks if `_realTimeCVIValue` is less than balanceCVIValue. Since they are initially the same, this condition will never be true, rendering this piece of logic useless.
```solidity
   function depositForOwner(address _owner, uint168 _tokenAmount, uint32 _realTimeCVIValue) external override returns (uint256 thetaTokensMinted) {
       require(msg.sender == fulfiller);


       uint32 balanceCVIValue = _realTimeCVIValue;
       if (_realTimeCVIValue < balanceCVIValue) {
           balanceCVIValue = _realTimeCVIValue;
       }
```
As the implemented fulfill mechanism allows for operations delay, the mentioned function should retrieve the CVI value from an oracle, and then compare it with the passed _realTimeCVIValue and update the value accordingly.

**Recommendation**: 

Retrieve the CVI value from the CVI oracle, compare it with _realTimeCVIValue and update the state accordingly.



### Missing Checks For Whether Arbitrum Sequencer Is Active

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The protocol intends to deploy to L2. ChainLink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum sequencer is active
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds
If the sequencer goes down, oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.

**Recommendation**: 

Use sequencer oracle inside the protocol, or else it might give stale prices for USDC and affect the liquidation process where we demand a certain peg from the returned amount.

## Low Risk

### Unvalidated referral codes allow users to claim undeserved affiliate benefits

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the _openPosition function within the Platform contract, openPositionFees is called with the user-provided referralCode. Inside the openPositionFees function, if _referralCode is not zero, it fetches the TierInfo and affiliate using the getInfoByCode function.
If a user provides a random referralCode that does not exist in the codeToAccount mapping of the referralManager, the codeToAccount mapping will return the default value for this mapping, which is address(0). As a result, when fetching the tierInfo corresponding to this non-existent affiliate, the accountToTier[address(0)] would be used. This will, in turn, again return a default value, which is 0. The effect of this is that tierToTierInfo[0] would be fetched, potentially giving the user the benefits of the TierInfo set at the constructor for the 0th tier.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a validation check in the getInfoByCode function to ensure that the returned affiliate address is not address(0) before fetching the TierInfo. If it is address(0), revert the transaction or return a default TierInfo without any benefits.



### Avoid using transfer for sending the native token

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract LowLatencyRequestFullFiller, the method refundExecutionFee(...) and method withdrawExecutionFee(...) use payable(...).transfer(...) for sending native token to an address. This uses a fixed 2300 gas and gas repricing may break this leading to execution fees not being refunded and being stuck in the contract forever resulting in loss of funds.

**Recommendation**: 

Use .call() instead to transfer native tokens.


### Missing `_disableInitializer()` implementation

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The following contracts inherit the Intializable.sol and implement the initialize(...) method with the initializer modifier without disabling the initializers for the implementation contract as recommended by OpenZeppelin here.

MegaThetaVault.sol
HedgedThetaVault.sol
ThetaVault.sol
VolatilityToken.sol
Platform.sol
PlatfomHelper.sol
UniswapV3LiquidityManager.sol

**Recommendation**: 

Disable the initializers for the implementation method as suggested by OpenZeppelin here.


### Approve amount 0 for tokens to previously used routers/managers

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract HedgedThetaVault, the method `setRewardRouter(...)` approves HedhedThetaVault tokens of amount type(uint).max to _thetaRewardTracker but does not approve 0 to all previous _thetaRewardTracker addresses used. It can lead to malicious activity if left unchecked. 

In Contract ThetaVault, the method setSwapRouter(...) approves token of amount type(uint).max to swapRouter but does not approve 0 to the old swap router address. The same method also approves vol tokens of amount type(uint).max to swapRouter without approving amount 0 to old swapRouter. The same applies to the method setLiquidityManager(...) as well. It can lead to malicious activity if left unchecked.
 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to approve 0 to previously used addresses.


### Method `setPlatform` does not check if the new platform is the same old platform

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract VolatilityToken, the method setPlatform(...) closes positions on the old platform and opens positions on the new platform. But it is not checking if the old platform is the same as the new platform which is advised to check.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check to ensure the new platform is not the same as the old platform.



### No address(0) check

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract HedgedThetaVault’s constructor does not check if the parameter _inversePlatform is address(0). Once address(0) is set, there is no method to assign any other value. 

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check to ensure the `_inversePlatform` parameter is not address(0).

## Informational

### Unsafe cast from int256 to uint256

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract CVIOracle.sol, the method getTruncatedCVIVaule(...) casts int256 cviOracleValue to uint256 cviValue without checking if the CviVaule == cviOracleVaule.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check to ensure the cast is safe.


### No need to initialize default values

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract Platform.sol, a few storage variables are being initialized to their default values which are not needed.
```solidity
canPurgeLatestSnapshot = false;
emergencyWithdrawAllowed = false;
fulfiller = address(0);
isReverse = false;
isDepleted = false;
```

**Recommendation**: 

Remove unnecessary initializations.



### Use specific Solidity compiler version

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Audited contracts use the following floating pragma:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8;
```
It allows to compile contracts with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.


### Unused import

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the Contract Elastic token, Initializable.sol is imported but not used.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove unused imports.

### Lack of events in the implementation of privileged functions

```

**Recommendation** 

Emit relevant events to announce the changes.


### Poor NatSpec Comments

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowleged

**Description**

Due to the nature of CVI protocol being complex, NatSpec comments would greatly influence the efficiency of outside reviewers reading the codebase. With proper NatSpec comments, a user might not interpret the intended functionality of the codebase. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is recommended to add NatSpec comments to ensure outside reviewers understand the intended functionality of the codebase. 

### Incorrect Comment Line

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract CVIReverseOracle, the function  getComputedCVIValue has a comment line that states “ // Truncate to 1 to avoid 0 cvi issues”. While this is correct, it would be easier to understand as “rounding” to 1 instead of truncation. 

**Recommendation**: 

We recommend making the change to increase code readability and understanding of the codebase.
