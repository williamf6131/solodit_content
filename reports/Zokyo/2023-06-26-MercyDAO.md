# Findings

## High Risk

###  Undeclared identifier

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Variable `_decimals` is not defined but is set in the constructor method

**Recommendation**: 

declare the variable as `uint8 immutable private _decimals` in the contract and override the `decimals`

function to return it's value:

```solidity
    function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
        return _decimals;
    }
```

### `boostRewards` sends tokens FROM vault instead of TO vault

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

on line 174 in the `boostRewards` function there is a call `IERC20(accrualToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);` which actually sends `accrualToken` to the caller from the vault. The real function should do vise versa.

**Recommendations**: 

replace `safeTransfer` with `safeTransferFrom` to send tokens from the caller to the vault.

### Not deployable contract

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The function `_batchInitialApprovals`, which is called from the constructor, tries to approve spending of the `disposeToken` to the `curveRouter` and also the `wrappedNative` to the `uniswapRouter`. Unfortunately, both `curveRouter` and `uniswapRouter` are not set at the moment, that's why contract deployment is reverted.

**Recommendations**: 

remove the `_batchInitialApprovals` call from the constructor method, and place it in the address set function.

### Cannot claim rewards

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Because `feeReceiver` is initially unset, the `claim` function reverts with the message "ERC20: transfer to the zero address"

**Recommendations**: 

add zero-address verification for the `feeReceiver` address in the initialization function. Add a `feeReceiver` set to the `setCoreAddresses` function


### `deposit` function is not working if `totalSupply()` is greater than zero

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

if the ``totalSupply()` is greater than zero and user calls `deposit` function, the call will be reverted with the message: "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call" because trying to access the `update()` function

**Recommendations**: 

fix the `nonReentrant` modifiers usage

### Potential reentrance issue

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

modifier updateReward on line 150 calls to the _executeSwap and then updates the state in the _notifyRewardAmount function. The _executeSwap does multiple external calls, including ETH transfers. This can lead to reentrance issues.

**Recommendations**: 

if you cannot put all state updates before calling external functions, consider putting `nonReentrant` on the `update()` function, which is public.

### `withdraw` function is not working if `emergencyWithdraw` is set to true

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

if the `emergencyWithdraw` is true and the user calls `withdraw` function, the call will be reverted with the message: "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call"

**Recommendations**: 

fix the `nonReentrant` modifiers usage


## Low Risk

### The `wrappedNative`, `curveRouter`, `uniswapRouter` and `feeReceiver` addresses are hard-coded.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

It's generally recommended to use a factory pattern or a configuration mechanism to allow flexibility in changing the router address in the future. Especially if you want to deploy the contract to other or test networks. Also, hard-coded values make it impossible to unit-test contracts.

**Recommendations**: 

Use a configurable mechanism to set addresses.

## Informational

### Consider adding event documentation in the form of `/// @dev` comments above each event declaration.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved


###  No comments or NatSpecs

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

### Variables could be immutable

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Proxy.sol, at line 7 inside the constructor, the impl parameter can be zero and is not checked. In case the address is zero, the proxy would not function properly and there is no fallback method to set the correct implementation after deployment.

**Recommendation**:

Add a sanity check for the to address variable not to be zero and revert otherwise.
