# Findings

## High Risk


###  Vesting Contract Can Be Overridden

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract EsEMBR.sol, the function addVester() can cause catastrophic failure of users' funds. If a contract is added with the same timeframe, then all of the users funds being calculated in the previous contract will be permanently lost as there is no way to track the funds on the new Vester contract.

**Recommendation**: 

It is recommended that there be a check when adding a Vester contract a validation check is done to ensure that a vesting contract cannot be overridden while assets are being vested.

**Comment**: 

The client fixed the issue in commit: c1e1fba2e1958f6a41d9b573ec6133a684260892

## Medium Risk

### Possible Sandwich Attack

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract EmberVualt.sol, the function liquidateToken() can be sandwich attacked due to having unlimited slippage and deadline. 

The code snippet above has zero and the max value of uint256 for slippage and deadline. This means that when liquidating a token, the token will take any amount against it. An MEV bot might pick this up and flashloan a trade against it to extract as much value as possible. This hurts the users of the protocol by extracting unnecessary value. 

**Recommendation**: 

Put a reasonable amount of slippage on the trade and do not allow for an infinite deadline. 

**Comment**: Client resolved the issue in commit: 609d6bff264c180b21fabd6a75e7658f6cb885f6

### Tokens Can Be Stuck

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

While calling liquidateToken(), the funds are sent from the token contract into the vault contract. When tokens are sent to be swapped at the router, the contract does not check if this is successful and optimistically assumes that it will work. If the operation somehow reverts, then the funds will not revert back to the token contract and will be stuck inside the Vault.

**Recommendation**: 

Use the catch statement to ensure errors do not occur. If they do occur, then revert the transaction to ensure funds are not lost.

**Comment**: Client resolved the issue in commit: 609d6bff264c180b21fabd6a75e7658f6cb885f6

### Constructor Parameter Validation

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract GenericERC20Token.sol, is highly recommended to perform a sanity check when setting the UniV2SwapRouter and UniV2Factory in this contract's constructor.

**Recommendation**: 

Ensure that the addresses of UniV2SwapRouter and UniV2Factory are not set to zero (address(0)). A zero address can lead to contract functionality issues and unexpected behavior.

**Comment**: The client fixed the issue in commit: c1e1fba2e1958f6a41d9b573ec6133a684260892 by updating the vault contract to never allow a zero address to be passed.

### Eth rewards might be stuck in contract

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In EsEMBR.sol - Contract can receive ETH in a scenario in which no token is minted (i.e. totalSupply = 0) .  ETH sent as a msg.value  contributes to the state of  totalEthPerEsembr  which in turn affects the rewards to be sent out.  In case of zero totalSupply, totalEthPerEsembr  remains unaffected hence no rewards for that sent ETH is retrievable making it effectively stuck. 

**Recommendation** 

function  receive() reverts if there is no totalSupply. Or keep track of the msg.value being sent in that scenario so it might be retrievable.


### Shares Are Not Updated During Burn 

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

EsEMBR.sol -  During demo testing phase client discovered an issue on calling vest(uint256 timeframe, uint256 amount) .  As this function burns the ERC20 of this contract which leads to a change of balance of the user calling it.  Rewards are not updated after changing the balance this leads to user receiving rewards calculated based on old balance. 
The impact of this finding though is mitigated by calling claim() before the vesting. Client resolved that issue once they discovered it by adding _updateRevShareForUser(0, msg.sender); before burning. 


### APR Can Be Higher Than Intended

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

 **Description**
 
EsEMBR.sol - During testing phase client discovered an issue with the payOffWeeks function. The issue occurred with the APR calculation and would increase in certain scenarios such as paying off attempting to pay off multiple weeks but not having enough funds. 

The client mediated the issue by adding the debt increase only if there was enough to pay the following week. The added code was added into the if statement if(newPending >= nextWeeksDebt)..... newDebt = newDebt2. 

## Low Risk

### Potential Unfair Liquidation Mechanic

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract EmberVault.sol, as the payup() is less than pending debt the team's token can have the liquidity pulled and the token be set to defaulted. Because of the high APY, a token can be liquidated within the first week and not have enough time to grow. This might be an intended mechanic, but it should be made clear in the documentation that developers need to be aware of their payment otherwise their token will be immediately taken down.

**Recommendation**: 

Clear documentation describing how the debt payment system works. Additionally, logic could be added to have different health scores for each token based on their risk score.

**Comment**: The client confirmed this was intended and will update documentation to assist users.

### Missing Zero Address Check

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

In the contact GenericERC20Token.sol, the following functions are missing zero address checks that could cause undesired effects:
```solidity
setRouter() 
setTaxReceiver() 
setExcludedFromLimits() 
setExcludedFromFees() 
setLP()
```

**Recommendation**:

Add a custom error or require statement to ensure the zero address cannot be passed.

Comment: The client fixed the issue in commit: c1e1fba2e1958f6a41d9b573ec6133a684260892

### Not Using SafeERC20

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Contracts include several occurrences of unsafe transfer of ERC20 tokens. This might lead to undesirable results if the transfer is not successful while the transaction is.


**Recommendation**: 

Utilize SafeERC20 for token transfers.

### Input Validation for Vesting Contract

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract Vester.sol, there should be a default minimum time a contract will allow for vesting a token. When a user vests a token, the token is usually locked up for over one year. However in the current implementation, a vesting contract could be launched with zero timeframe and instantly unlock all tokens.

**Recommendation**: 


A reasonable time frame should be enforced to ensure unintended timeframes are set during the deployment of the Vester contract.

**Comment**: The client fixed the issue in commit: c1e1fba2e1958f6a41d9b573ec6133a684260892 by requiring the time frame to be greater than zero.

## Informational

### Arithmetic operations

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The SafeMath library is used for arithmetic operations in this contract. However, as of Solidity version 0.8 and later, SafeMath is no longer required for preventing arithmetic overflow/underflow issues. Solidity 0.8 introduced built-in overflow checks, making SafeMath redundant.

**Recommendation**:

It is recommended to remove the 'using SafeMath for uint256;' statement to simplify the code and reduce gas costs. You can rely on the built-in overflow checks provided by Solidity for arithmetic operations.


### Centralization Risk

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the contract(s) GenericERC20Token.sol, EsEmber.sol, EsEMBRRewardsDistributor.sol, and EmberVault.sol, the owners of the contracts have excessive authority over the functionality of the smart contracts. The excessive authority granted to the admin poses a vulnerability in the contracts. The central issue is that the admin has unrestricted access to critical functions and general setters/mutators. The owner of the GenericERC20Token has potential excessive control over tokens deposited within the contract. If a malicious actor were to get control of the GenericERC20Token contract after it has paid off the debt, then excessive minting could occur. This concentration of power raises concerns, especially when certain functions carry higher risks than others. Depending on the project's objectives, it is advisable to implement governance mechanisms or utilize multisig wallets to distribute control and mitigate potential risks associated with a single wallet's authority. 
The owner of the contracts have control over the following functions: 

EsEMBRRewardsDistributor.sol:
setEmissionPerSecondEmbr() - Change the reward rate of Ember for the vault contract. 
setEmissionPerSecondEth() - Change the reward rate of Ether for the vault contract. setEsEMBR() - change the esEmber address. 
EsEmber.sol:
addVester() - Add a new vesting contract with a new timeframe. 
setRevShareSource() - toggle addresses ability to send ether to the contract. 

GenericERC20Token:
addLiquidity() - Add liquidity once at the start of the contract. This is covered by the vault contract after the token is created. 
mint()  - Mint an unlimited amount of tokens after the debt is paid off up to the maximum supply set during deployment. 
withdrawTokens() - Withdraw all tokens that were sent to the contract but only tokens created by the contract itself. Third party tokens cannot be saved. 
withdrawEth() - Withdraw all the ether sent to the contract. 
disableTransfers() - Set the status of the contract into default. This disables all transfers and limits functionality of the contract. 
transferOwnershipToRealOwner() - Transfers the ownership of the contract after the debt is paid off. 
setInitialLiquidityPool() - Sets the initial liquidity pool for the token. 
disableMinting() - Permanently disables the ability to mint tokens and sets the max supply to equal the current supply. 
setLP() - Sets the address of the LP address and toggles a boolean to enable or enable an address from being an LP. 
setExcludedFromFees() - Removes the buy and sell fees from an address.
setExcludedFromLimits() - Removes the transaction limit from an address.
setTaxReceiver() - Sets the address that receives the buy and sell taxes from users. 
setRouter() - Changes the router to an address the developer chooses. 
setTaxes() - Changes the buy and sell taxes up to 25.2% for each. Buy tax can be 25.2% and the sell tax can be 25.2%. 

**Recommendation**: 


It is important that some functionality is locked behind a time lock or time lock implementation so users funds are not at stake and cannot be manipulated. Additionally, adding multi-sig, governance, and/or a timelock. Lowering control over tokens deposited into the contract would lower risk severity. 


### Multiplier Can Leave a Shortfall of Funds

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract Vester.sol, a multiplier is set during deployment and is used to calculate the return value for a claimable amount. The local variable claimable_amount can equal the entire amount of the vested tokens. However, the calculation multiplying claimable_amount by the multiplier and dividing by 10000 could leave a shortfall in the contract if the multiplier is set egregiously higher than intended.

**Recommendation**: 

Set a parameter or require statement limiting the size of the multiplier to ensure that a shortfall of Ember cannot occur.

**Comment**: The client fixed the issue in commit: c1e1fba2e1958f6a41d9b573ec6133a684260892

### Unreasonable Tax For Buy and Sell

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

In the contract GenericERC20Token.sol, the constructor and function `setTaxes()` allows a user to set the buy and sell tax up to 25.2% for either tax. The buy and sell taxes should be set to a reasonable level where users will not lose a majority of their assets when buying and selling. 

**Recommendation**: 

Choose a reasonable threshold value to protect users assets. 

### Price Manipulation of `sell_threshold`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract GenericERC20Token.sol, the `sell_threshold` can be gamified. Because `sell_threshold` is public data, bots can be set up to extract value from the pool when the threshold is about to be hit. The larger the threshold, the larger the gamification and potential swing in price might be.
For example: Price is trading at 1.25 USD and the liquidity is 200,000. 
The sell_threshold is at 5,000 USD when this is sold against the liquidity it will push the price down in terms of Tokens/ETH. A bot can be set up to sell right before each threshold and gain more tokens over time. Eventually the user will dump a large amount of tokens on the supply. 

**Recommendation**:

Choosing an optimal number to reduce gamification and extraction of value from users’ funds.

### Uniformed Variable Typing

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Throughout the codebase many variables are initialized as uint256 and uint. Under the hood, all `uint` is initialized as uint256. However, to remain consistent throughout the codebase it is better practice to list all intended uint256 variables to be initialized as such.

**Recommendation**: 

It is recommended to change all uint variables to uint256. 

**Comment**: 

The client fixed the issue in commit: c1e1fba2e1958f6a41d9b573ec6133a684260892

### Unchecked Return Value of External Call


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract EsEMBR.sol, the function vest() does not handle the return value for an external contract call to the Vester contract. 

**Recommendation**: 

All external calls that return a value should be handled by default.

**Comment**: The client fixed the issue in commit: c1e1fba2e1958f6a41d9b573ec6133a684260892



### Custom Errors

**Severity** : Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Throughout the codebase, `require` statements are used instead of custom errors. Custom errors are available from solidity version ^0.8.4. The contracts are on solidity version ^0.8.0 but are using a form of customized errors by importing `Errors.sol`. Custom errors can roughly save 50 gas per call. This gas is saved because of not having to allocate the string and store the string through the revert. Throughout the contracts in the codebase, `require` statements are used instead of custom errors. Custom errors save gas on deployment as well.

**Recommendation**: 

Convert `require` statements to custom errors to save gas on each function call and deployment. If this is unnecessary, this finding will be deleted.

### Floating Pragma

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Throughout the codebase, the contracts that are unlocked at version ^0.8.19, and it should always be deployed with the same compiler version. By locking the pragma to a specific version, contracts are not accidentally getting deployed by using an outdated version that can introduce unintended consequences.

Comment: The client fixed the issue in commit: c1e1fba2e1958f6a41d9b573ec6133a684260892

### Empty Catch Statement

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

The empty catch statement could handle errors from a fail swap and not revert silently. By using the catch users will be able to correctly identify why their transaction might have reverted.

**Recommendation**:

Use the catch statement to report errors that can happen during the external call during the swap. 

**Comment**:  Client resolved the issue in EmberVault.sol. There are occurrences of that issue in FreeERC20.sol and GenericERC20Token.sol which were not addressed.

### Leftover Test Code

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

In the contract EmberVault.sol at line 276 has leftover test code that is commented out. All testing code should be removed before being pushed to the production environment. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is recommended to remove any testing code before deploying the contracts. 

**Comment**: Client partly resolved the issue in commit: 609d6bff264c180b21fabd6a75e7658f6cb885f6


### Unknown Usage of State Variable

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract GenericERC20Token.sol the state variable uint[]  Extra is not used within the contract itself. As the use case for this is unknown, it would be beneficial to understand what the intended use case for Extra is.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement  uint[]  Extra or remove it from the contract. 

**Comment**: The client fixed the issue in commit by removing it from the codebase: c1e1fba2e1958f6a41d9b573ec6133a684260892


### Wrong value of precision

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Vester.sol - precision value is set to
uint256 public precision = 10e9

But according to function vest(), the error message in the first line states that precision should be 1e9.
```solidity
// This function is only called by esEMBR contract. esEMBR also calls claim for this user.
function vest(address user, uint256 amount) onlyEsEMBR external returns (uint) {
    require(amount >= precision, "Vester: Amount cant be smaller than 1,000,000,000");
    ...
}
```
**Recommendation** 

Correction to precision value is needed.


**Comment**: Client resolved the issue in commit: 609d6bff264c180b21fabd6a75e7658f6cb885f6

### Lack events in implementation of privileged functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Some functions that carry out important changes to contracts state emit no events on changing significant parameters of the contracts by admin or other. This is taking place in a number of external state changing functions in the following files below.
In EmberVault.sol
function setRewardSettings(uint _base, uint _max, uint _rate) onlyOwner external 
function setEsEMBR(address payable _esEmbr) onlyOwner external 
function addPackage(Package calldata _package) external onlyOwner 
function setPackageEnabled(uint package_id, uint8 _status) external onlyOwner 
function unstakeEth(uint amount, address unstaker) onlyEsEMBR external  
In EsEMBRRewardsDistributor.sol
function setEsEMBR(address payable _esEmbr) external onlyOwner 
function setEmissionPerSecondEth(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner
function setEmissionPerSecondEmbr(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner 

In GenericERC20Token.sol
function addLiquidity(uint token_amount) external payable onlyOwner returns(address)
function withdrawEth() external onlyOwner returns (uint) 
function disableTransfers() external onlyOwner 
function setInitialLiquidityPool(address _addy) public onlyOwner
function disableMinting() public onlyOwner 
function setLP(address _lp, bool _bool) onlyOwner external 
function setExcludedFromFees(address _address, bool _bool) onlyOwner external 
function setExcludedFromLimits(address _address, bool _bool) onlyOwner external 
function setTaxReceiver(address _tax_receiver) onlyOwner external 
function setRouter(address router) onlyOwner external 
function setTaxes(uint8 _buyTax, uint8 _sellTax) onlyOwner external 

In EsEMBR.sol
function addVester(uint timeframe, IVester vester) onlyOwner external 
function setRevShareSource(address _source, bool _enabled) onlyOwner external 

**Recommendation** 

Emit relevant events to announce the changes.

**Comment**: The client updated some events to be emitted for payup, stakeEmbr, and unstakeEmbr in commit: c1e1fba2e1958f6a41d9b573ec6133a684260892. 


### Claimable Can Initially Return Zero 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the contract EsEmbr.sol, the function claimable can cause confusion to external users. The intended functionality is to return the EsEmbr thats is available to be claimed. If a user has not called a function that changes the state of mapping(address => uint256) claimableRewards, then this value can return zero even though the true value is not zero. 

**Recommendation**:

Simulate the return value of claim without changing state if claimableRewards  is equal to zero to mitigate confusion of users as . However, the front end could solve this problem by creating a static call and showing the return value of to_claim. The downside to the alternative front end approach is that checking the value on tools such as Etherscan would still return zero.
