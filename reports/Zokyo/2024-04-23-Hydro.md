# Findings

## High Risk

### Anyone could remove anyone from the blacklist

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Invalid

**Where**: token.move


**Details**: 

the function "remove_addr_from_blacklist" doesn't contain any ownership checks, so anyone could call it by providing the current `DenyList` as well as any address in the giving list, resulting in the removal of the provided address from the `DenyList`.

**Recommendations**: 

by analogy with other mutating functions in the given contract, add an input argument of the type Owner and check its "owner" field to be equal to the transaction sender address	

## Informational

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Where**: vesting.move#7,8,9,11,12,15,16

The module contains "use" items that are not used in the code

Remove unused "use" items"

Consider using simplified syntax
