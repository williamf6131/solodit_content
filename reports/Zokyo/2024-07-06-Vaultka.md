# Findings

## High Risk

### `Position_amount` never updated after withdrawal

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: strategy/programs/vaultka/src/lib.rs

**Description**

The function `request_deposit` sets initiates the "PositionInfo" with
`position_amount=0`. Then, the function `execute_deposit` updates it to be equal to
`received_amount` right before the end of the function execution. The `request_withdraw`
uses this value to determine the amount to be withdrew and, actually does send tokens to
the keeper. There's also no check if the position_info.is_in_withdraw_request is already
`true`, which makes it possible to call it again many times always getting the tokens.

**Recommendation**

re-check the logic in those four function, it seems to be totally corrupted. Try to isolate
functionality and make sure to document all checks you needed



### Debt could be relieved without repayment

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 614

**Description**

the `repay` function increases a `vault_sol_balance` and decreases a
`borrowed_amount` without receiving any payments

**Recommendation**

add a Transfer function to get the payment from the borrower


## Medium Risk

### Centralized control in the program

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Both programs (strategy and vault) have centralized control. In the Strategy
program, an admin account can manually specify any amount within either execute_withdraw
or execute_deposit, while in the Vault program, any whitelisted account can borrow assets
and repay the debt without paying assets back.

**Recommendation**

update methods to decrease centralization

### User should be both `keeper` and `owner` to be able to set `to_be_liquidated = true`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: strategy/programs/vaultka/src/lib.rs: 902 and 913

**Description**

In the `request_withdraw` function in the case when "dtv" is greater or equals
to the "strategy.dtv_limit", there is a check for the `accounts.user` to be the strategy keeper.
and right after that, on the line 913 it checks the same user to be an owner of the position

**Recommendation**

Make sure the owner and the keeper could be the same account for this case to work

## Low Risk

### Price multiplied by ten

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: strategy/programs/vaultka/src/lib.rs: 692, 705

**Description**

In the `request_deposit` function there are two statement: `sol_price =
sol_price * 10` and `jlp_price = jlp_price * 10`, that do not make any sense.

**Recommendation**

Please make sure if it s needed and if so, add comments to explain this adjustment.

### Duplicated check

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: strategy/programs/vaultka/src/lib.rs: 907 and 913

**Description**

In the `request_withdraw` function in the case when "dtv" is less than
"strategy.dtv_limit", there is a check for the `accounts.user` to be equal to
`position_info.user`, but right after that it is checked again.

**Recommendation**

Remove duplicated check

### The event doesn't have an address

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 345

**Description**

The function `set_whitelisted_user` fires an event `AddedWhitelistedUser` with
only one boolean flag: "whitelisted: true" which makes no sense.

**Recommendation**

Include the whitelisted address for the event.

### The event doesn't have an address

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 361

**Description**

The function `disable_whitelisted_user` fires an event
`DisabledWhitelistedUser` with only one boolean flag: "whitelisted: true" which makes no
sense.

**Recommendation**

Include the whitelisted address for the event.

### unused account field

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 171

**Description**

The `Deposit` structure defines an account `program_authority` with an
`AUTHORITY_SEED`, but it is never used

**Recommendation**

make sure you don't need this account in the deposit function and remove it from the
structure

### use `sub_lamports` and `add_lamports`

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 539,540,543,544,601,602

**Description**

The anchor has functions to sub/add lamports, which are more ergonomic,
performant, and have additional checks.

**Recommendation**

use anchor-provided functions to sub/add lamports to accounts

### Incorrect error message

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 628

**Description**

the code is checking for the `whitelisted.whitelisted` but the error thrown is
`InvalidBorrowAmount`

**Recommendation**

make sure the thrown errors are correct

## Informational

### Code quality

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The code quality of the project is bad. The code is not well structured and the
code is not well commented.
Functions are overly complex and the code is not modular. The code itself is very hard to
read, not self-explanatory, and hard to maintain.

**Recommendation**

Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable. Use proper naming
conventions and break down the code into smaller functions.

### Unnecessary variables

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: strategy/programs/vaultka/src/lib.rs: 712,713

**Description**

In the `request_deposit` function there are two variables introduced: `jlp_p`
and `sol_p` that are excessive.

**Recommendation**

Change the declaration of initial `jlp_price` and `sol_price` as `u128` and you'll never need
excessive vars.

### Path prefix not necessary

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 399,425,430

**Description**

The code uses the following constructions:
`anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke`, while the `anchor_lang` is already
imported, so it can be omitted.

**Recommendation**

omit `anchor_lang` in the declaration when it has already been imported. ie:
`solana_program::program::invoke`

### Unsigned check for less than zero

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 421,502,571,618,622

**Description**

The unsigned int variable could not be less than zero by the definition

**Recommendation**

compare it only for the equality, i.e.: `if deposit_amount == 0 {`

### Unnecessary variables

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 712,713

**Description**

In the `borrow` function, an excessive variable is introduced: `utilization_rate`.

**Recommendation**

Either make `get_utilization_rate` to return Result<u64>, or use
`vault_data.max_utilization_rate` as u128 in the comparison


### Multiple calls to the same field

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: (numerous places)

**Description**

We identified that through the entire code, there are innumerable places when
the same field is accessed multiple times (i.e., ctx.accounts.lending_account") without
creating a local variable or even a local variable but in the same context, the field is being
accessed for the read again

**Recommendation**

use local variables when there are multiple reads from the same struct field
