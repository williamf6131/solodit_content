# Findings

## High Risk

### Logic edge case allow to bypass deposit and mint StableVault tokens

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Trading.sol, function _handleDeposit at line #769, unchecked data might lead to undefined behavior. Given that _permitData is an input value from an external function, the field `usePermit` can be set to false, therefore avoiding the ERC20Permit function call. This way the execution continues to the next block, where the marginAsset is transferred to the Trading contract from the `_trader` and the result from the transferFrom function is unchecked so if the token will not revert and returns false the execution will continue, in conlusion even if the _marginAsset has not been approved by the trader, the contract still calls the StableVault `deposit` function which mints stable vault tokens.

**Recommendation**: 

Add whitelisting for tokens and don’t whitelist tokens with empty fallback functions if they don’t have permit functionality and also add the SafeERC20 library and refactor from transferFrom to safeTransferFrom function.

## Medium Risk

### Inaccurate update of limitPrice

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract TradingExtension in function “_limitClose” at lines #94 and #102 the variable “_limitPrice” is updated using “_trade.tpPrice” or “_trade.slPrice” fields. The assignment of these variables happens if all the previous checks passed, but given those checks' logic, it might be inaccurate to update the `_limitPrice` using the `_trade` fields if the price have spiked considerable more then the “tpPrice” or “slPrice”

**Recommendation**: 

Use the `_price` variable to update the `_limitPrice`. 


### Possible underflow in decimals calculations

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract Trading in function “_handleDeposit” at line #775 the “_marginDecMultiplier” is the result of calculating the multiplier based on the “_marginAsset” decimals. The calculation assumes that the token's decimals are always smaller or equal than 18, but this is not always the case. Using the hardcoded value can lead to an underflow in the following expression “18 - ERC21(_marginAsset).decimals”. This reverts, but it still posses a risk for the trading contract as it makes a `_marginAsset` unusable due to the calculations always failing.

**Recommendation**: 

Don't use a hardcoded value and handle such cases when margin assets might not follow the standard 18 decimals or less, that most tokens follow. 


### Use `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer` from SafeERC20

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Trading.sol, there are multiple places where the IERC20 interface is used for the interaction with several tokens. However, there are also cases where the result of functions is not checked, for example ‘transfer’ function at line 804 which can result in weird edge cases as there are a lot of ERC20 tokens who do not behaves as developers usually expect. 

**Recommendation**

Add the usage of SafeERC20 library to ensure safe token transfers, in line with best practices.

## Informational

###  Redundant use of uint256

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract TradingExtension, function “getVerifiedPrice” at line #143, the function argument “_withSpreadIsLong” is declared as uint256 even it acts as a flag and takes small values. This is also found in function “initiateLimitOrder” for “_orderType”

**Recommendation**

Use uint8 for such variables that act as flags
