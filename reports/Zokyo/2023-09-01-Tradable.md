# Findings

## High Risk

### Method withdrawalToAddressRequest and withdrawalToAddressRequestForUser do not send tokens to the `receiver` address

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TradableSideVault, methods withdrawalToAddressRequest and withdrawalToAddressRequestForUser are used to withdraw tokens to a `receiver` address.

These methods call the method `marginWithdrawalToAddress` in the contract TradableMarginHandler on the base chain.

Method `marginWithdrawalToAddress` further callback the side-chains side vault contract but without the `receiver` parameter. Instead, it encodes the `user` address, which means withdrawal tokens are sent to the `user` address instead of the `receiver` address.

This defeats the purpose of having methods withdrawalToAddressRequest and withdrawalToAddressRequestForUser for receiving withdrawal tokens in the receiver account.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the method `marginWithdrawalToAddress` in the TradableMarginHandler contract to encode the `receiver` address instead of the `user` address.



### Unsafe uint64 casting may overflow

**Severity**: High

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The `_stake` internal function in TradableStaking contract is responsible for updating and generating staking positions during the deposit of funds. It assigns the calculated values to the Stake struct. However, the function cast amountToBase and userShares value to uint64, which has a maximum possible value of approximately 18.5 ETH. In cases where these computed values surpass the maximal limits, a silent overflow can occur, potentially leading to inaccuracies within the protocol's accounting.

**Recommendation**: 

Do not cast the mentioned values to uint64. 

### Lack of proper integration with Gelato relay

**Severity**: High

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The protocol employs Gelato for gasless transactions, enabling users to send transactions without a native token balance. However, with off-chain relaying, msg.sender no longer denotes the user initiating the transaction. When relaying a message to a target smart contract function, it becomes crucial for the function to authenticate the origin of the message and verify that it was correctly forwarded by the designated relayer. To address this challenge, Gelato recommends the utilization of an ERC-2771 compliant contract. This type of contract implements data encoding to relay the original _msgSender from off-chain, ensuring that only the trusted forwarder is able to encode this value. However, the TradableSideVault contract uses GelatoRelayContext, which lacks ERC-2771 compatibility. As a result, any function with the onlyGelatoRelay modifier becomes unusable. The use of the _msgSender() function originates from the Context.sol contract which solely returns the msg.sender value. In the situation where a transaction is initiated through the Gelato relayer, invoking `_msgSender()` will yield the address used by the relayer to forward the transaction, rather than the original user’s address.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement the Gelato’s ERC-2771 complaint logic and follow the security best practices. 



### Missing `onlyGelatoRelay` modifier

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract `TradableSideVault`, there are several methods that are “ForUser” meaning those methods will be called on behalf of a user and using _msgSender() for getting the address for the user.

Although these methods are using _msgSender(), they are missing the onlyGelatoRelay modifier. It defeats the purpose of having another method with the only difference of using _msgSender(). 

```solidity
function stakingAccountDepositForUser(
address token,
uint256 amount
) external {
 
function stakeFromMarginAccountForUser(
address token,
uint256 amount
) external {

function withdrawalRequestForUser(
WithdrawalType withdrawalType,
address token,
uint256 amount
) external {
```

**Recommendation**: 

Add `onlyGelatoRelay` modifier to the above methods.

**Fixed**: Acknowledged and removed these methods.



### Methods related to Staking on SideVault Contract encode incorrect staking/withdrawal methods for Base chain
 
**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TradableSideVault, method stakingAccountDepositForUser(...) and method stakingAccountDeposit encodes the keyword, destination base chain contract address, and the destination method along with the parameters. The destination base chain contract is the staking vault address. 

```solidity
// message being sent
bytes memory payload = abi.encode(
"md",
dstBaseStakingVault,
abi.encodeWithSignature(
"marginAccountDeposit(address,(address,uint8,bool),uint256)",
msg.sender,
getAcceptedTokenInfo(token),
amount
)
);
```
Whereas it is encoding method `marginAccountDeposit` which is not implemented in the Staking Vault contract. This will fail to stake for the user.  

Similarly, method withdrawalRequest and method withdrawalRequestForUser encodes the data in the above-mentioned logic but here the destination base chain contract could be the staking vault address (dstBaseStakingVault) based on withdrawal type.

```solidity
// creates messages using user data and send to base chain
address destinationVault = withdrawalType == WithdrawalType.Stake
? dstBaseStakingVault
: dstBaseMarginVault;
bytes memory payload = abi.encode(
"mw",
destinationVault,
abi.encodeWithSignature(
"marginAccountWithdrawal(address,(address,uint8,bool),uint256,address)", 
msg.sender,
getAcceptedTokenInfo(token),
amount,
address(this)
)
);
```
Whereas the method encoded is marginAccountWithdrawal which is again not implemented in the staking vault contract. This will fail withdrawal for users.


**Recommendation**: 

Update the encoding to use either the correct destination base chain address or the correct method on the staking vault contract.

## Medium Risk

### No method to withdraw stuck ETH 

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract `TradableSettingsMessageAdapter`, there is no method to withdraw the stuck ETH in case this contract is not used anymore. 

This contract will have ETH as it will be used for paying fees to send messages on across chains using Layer Zero.

Recommendation: Add a method similar to the method `transferGas(...)` in the TradableSideVault contract to transfer stuck ETH only for admin.


### Excessive fee is not refunded to the user

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

The swapLiquidity function in TradableSideVault contract is able to execute swap using the Stargate router. Users can call this function externally, supplying a fee in native tokens. However, in case of excessive fees being provided, the surplus is refunded to the contract address itself, rather than the msg.sender address.

Recommendation: Set msg.sender address as a refund address.

### Division before multiplication incurs an unnecessary precision loss

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

In Solidity, performing division before multiplication can lead to a loss of precision due to integer division truncation. This means that the fractional part of the result is truncated, leading to inaccurate calculations. The calculation of the amount to the base token is performed in the following way:
return amount / (10**selectedToken.decimals) * (10**ITradableSettings(settingsProvider).getDefaultDecimal());

or
uint256 amountToBase = amount / (10**selectedToken.decimals) * (10**stakingSettings.baseDecimal);

**Recommendation**: 

Avoid division before multiplication and always perform division operations at the end.


### Transfer/TransferFrom are used instead of their counterparts from SafeERC20

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The ERC20.transfer(), ERC20.transferFrom() and ERC20.approve() functions return a boolean value indicating success. Some ERC20 tokens that are not compliant with the specification could return false from the transfer function call to indicate that the transfer fails, but the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked.The EIP-20 specification requires checking the return value.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider implementing OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20.



### Contract accepts ETH unnecessarily 

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

 Across the protocol, there are several contracts that accept ETH as it implements the following:

receive() external payable {}

Although there are several contracts that do not need ETH. The following are the two contracts:

Contract TradableBalanceVault is using TradableSettingsMessageAdapter.sendMessage(...) for sending messages across the chain so it doesn’t need ETH.

Contract TradableSettings is using TradableSettingsMessageAdapter.sendMessage(...) for sending messages across the chain so it doesn’t need ETH.


**Recommendation**: 

Update the contracts to not accept ETH if not needed, as they can get stuck forever.

**Fix 1**: 

The issue was fixed partially by commit 98f10c19c1708f86fb503ff2aaa8d20b6ffc8677. It is recommended to remove both the receive() method  and withdrawStuckETH(...) method from contract TradableSettings. 
Since the contract TradableSettings is using TradableSettingsMessageAdapter.sendMessage(...) for sending messages across the chain, so it doesn’t need ETH. 


### Missing implementation of `marginAccountDepositFromFundingAccount`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the SideMarginFundingAccount contract, the marginAccountDepositFromFundingAccount() function, which is called on line: 132, does not exist in the TradeableSideVault contract. This can lead to the function reverting, always leading to incorrect execution of function than intended and thus leading to Denial of Service.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to define the function properly in the expected contract and review business and operational logic.

### LayerZero recommendations not followed

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the TradableSettingsMessageAdapter contract, the Layer Zero best practices as mentioned here are not followed. It states that- 
“It is highly recommended User Applications implement the ILayerZeroApplicationConfig. Implementing this interface will provide you with forceResumeReceive which, in the worse case can allow the owner/multisig to unblock the queue of messages if something unexpected happens”
It is advised that the TradableSettingsMessageAdapter implements this ILayerZeroApplicationConfig. 

Also most importantly, there is missing implementation of a nonblocking receiver in the TradableSettingsMessageAdapter contract, as recommended here by Layerzero. This again helps to mitigate the issue of blocked queue of messages when using  Layerzero. Also be sure to setTrustedRemote() to enable inbound communication on all contracts as recommended. Otherwise it could lead to potential Denial of Service.


**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to follow the above Layerzero recommendations and Best practices and implement them.


### Centralization issue in TradableBalanceVault, TradableSettingsMessageAdapter and TradeableSettings

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the TradableBalanceVault contract, the settingsProvider can be changed anytime by an admin using setSettingsProvider() function. A malicious admin can exploit it by changing the settingsProvider to a malicious contract, thereby leading to potential loss of funds of users.

Also, the same setSettingsProvider() exists in the TradableSettingsMessageAdapter contract and thus the same issue above is applicable.

Similarly, ownerContract can be changed anytime by an admin using the changeOwnerContract() function. Setting this to a malicious contract can lead to potential reentrancy issues and loss of funds.

The protocolRewardPercentage and protocolRewardPercentageDenominator can be changed anytime without users noticing. It could also lead to exploitation by a malicious admin, as the can change it to a very high value or very low value. This can be unfair for users if they are unable to notice these changes and unknowingly initiate transactions.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to decentralize the usage of these functions by using a multisig wallet with at least 2/3 or a 3/5 configuration of trusted users. Alternatively, a secure governance mechanism can be utilized for the same.

## Low Risk

### Use of single step ownership transfer

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

The TradableSideVault and TradableSettings contracts implement the setAdminUser function, which allows changing the adminUser address. If the admin’s address is set incorrectly, this could potentially result in critical functionalities becoming locked.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider implementing a two-step pattern. Utilize OpenZeppelin's Ownable2Step contract.

**Fixed**: 

Issue fixed by commit 98f10c19c1708f86fb503ff2aaa8d20b6ffc8677. The setAdminUser function was removed from TradableSideVault. The TradableSettings contract implement Ownable2Step.

### The zroPaymentAddress is hardcoded as a zero-address

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

The sendMessage function in TradableSideVault contract calculates required fees and sends a message to LayerZero endpoint. In accordance with the integration checklist it is advisable to provide zroPaymentAddress value as a parameter, allowing for potential future adjustments, rather than hardcoding it as a static zero address value.

**Recommendation**: 

Pass the zroPaymentAddress value to the send function as a parameter.

### Missing zero amount and address checks

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the TradableBalanceVault contract, there is a missing non-zero check for the amount parameter in the marginAccountWithdrawal() function. This could accidentally lead to the withdrawal of 0 amount being processed, which could lead to unnecessary transactions and gas wastage.
Also, there is a missing zero address check for the receiver. This could lead to a loss of funds for users if a zero address is accidentally used by users for the receiver parameter.
In Contract TradableSideVault, the sendMessage(...) method has a `destination` parameter which is not checked for address(0). It is advised to check if the `destination` parameter is address(0) and revert if it is.

In Contract TradableSettings.sol, the constructor sets the `adminUser` which is used all across the protocol contracts and does not validate if the given parameter _adminUser is address(0) or not. In case, the admin user is set address(0), the contract may be needed to be deployed again. 


**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add a missing zero amount check as well as a zero address check for the mentioned methods.

### Unlimited public minting for Stable Token

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract StableToken, the method mintTo(...) is public and allows anyone to mint any amount of tokens. The contract has an owner so it is advised to allow only the owner to mint the tokens. We understand this contract is just for testing purposes so this is just a low severity issue. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to refrain from using this contract in production. Also, update the mintTo(...) to be used only by admin.




### Default Decimal and `protocolRewardPercentageDenominator` can be set to `0`

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


In Contract TradableSideVault, the method setDefaultDecimal allows the defaultDecimal value to be set `0` which will cause the method `convertAmountToTokenDecimal` or any method using defaultDecimal to return unexpected results. 

In Contract TradableSettings, the method setProtocolSettings allows the owner to set protocolRewardPercentageDenominator to be 0 which will result into divide by 0 wherever it is used since it is a denominator value.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a `require` statement to ensure that defaultDecimal and protocolRewardPercentageDenominator are not set to 0.

**Fix 1:** 

The issue was fixed partially by commit 98f10c19c1708f86fb503ff2aaa8d20b6ffc8677. It is recommended to to add the check to ensure that 
protocolRewardPercentageDenominator is not set to 0 as well in the method setProtocolRewardSettings.



### Lack of proper upper limits 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the Tradeable Settings contract, protocolRewardPercentage and protocolRewardPercentageDenominator should have maximum limits. Otherwise, it could accidentally lead to assigning inconsistent and arbitrary numbers that could lead to values that do not conform to the percentage calculations intended. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add maximum limits or relative limits in order to mitigate this issue.
 
### Missing sanity checks in TradeableSettings and TradableSideVault

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the TradeableSettings contract, there are missing sanity checks in setMarketMakerMarginSettings() function for minMarginDeposit, liquidationPeriod, and protocolLiquidationPercentage. 

This could lead to issues, for example, minMarginDeposit can be set to 0, which would mean that one does not need to deposit anything at all for the margin account. The liquidationPeriod could also be set to very low values, leading to more issues. 

Also, the protocolLiquidationPercentage could be set to a very high value leading to inconsistent and impractical percentage calculations. 

In addition to this, in the TradableSideVault contract,  there are missing sanity checks in the function setStakingSettings(). A missing non-zero check for minStakingDeposit could mean that the user can stake 0 tokens, which are logically incorrect and could introduce more issues.
It is advised to add at least a non-zero check for the minStakingDeposit. The same is advised for minStakingWithdrawal.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add proper required checks and sanity checks for all the above parameters in the TradeableSettings as well as the TradableSideVault contract.
Comments: The team added the required sanity checks for setMarketMakerMarginSettings(), but decided not to add checks to the setStakingSettings() function to conform to the working principle of the system.

### Missing zero address check for endpoint

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

In the TradableSettingsMessageAdapter contract, there is a missing zero address check for the endpoint in the constructor. 
Similarly, in the TradableSideVault contract, there is a missing zero address check for the endpoint in the constructor. It is important to add a zero address check here because the endpoint can be set only once.
In addition to this, in the TradableSideVault contract,  there is a missing zero address check for adminUser in setAdminUser() function.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add a proper require check for the same.

### For loop over the dynamic array

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**


There exists a for loop on line: 199 which loops over sideVaultsList.This can be problematic because it is a dynamic array and could lead to out of gas issues if its length increases a lot. It also exists on line: 395 and line: 307. Alternatively, a removeSideVaultsList function can be added to remove sideVaults if the looping leads to out of gas issues. But this would introduce the risk of existing vaults with funds being removed from the list, which could lead to more issues like Denial of Service for users. 

**Recommendation**:  

It is advised to put a max limit on the sideVaultsList in order to mitigate this issue.


### Admin user can `unstake` without fulfilling the staking period

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract TradableStaking, the method _unstake(...) implemented the following logic
```solidity
if (user != ITradableSettings(settingsProvider).getAdminUser()) {
uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - (uint256(_stakes.timestamp));
require(
timeDiff > uint256(stakingSettings.stakingPeriod),
"period"
);
// console.log("timeDiff: %d", timeDiff);
}
  ```
Here it means that the admin user can unstake without fulfilling the staking period.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a multi-sig account for the admin user. 


## Informational

### Unindexed events Or Missing events

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TradableSideVault, none of the events have indexed parameters. Most user actions are initiated from this contract only so it is advised to make the `user` parameter indexed in events. For example:

event SideChainWithdrawalInitiated(
address user,
address token,
uint256 amount
);

In Contract TradableSideVault, the method deactivateAcceptedToken(...) is not emitting an event. It is advisable to emit an event for this update as well.

**Recommendation**: 

Index the `user` parameter in Side Vault events.




### Missing or Wrong Natspec comments

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract TradableSideVault, the constructor has several parameters but the natspec comment only describes one parameter. It is advised to add a description for all parameters.

In Contract TradableSideVault, update the natspec comment of `setDestinationConfiguration` method. 

In Contract TradableSideVault, method _nonblockingLzReceive(...) have comments which mention the keywords for many actions which are possible to be called from base chain to side chain vaults. It is missing descriptions for keywords such as “ms”, “ss”, “sdd”. It is advised to add the explanation for these keywords as well.

In Contract Tradable Balance Vault, the method transferWithdrawableBalance(...) allows the admin to transfer the withdrawable balance from its own account to the receiver account. Although the comment mentions, this method should allow users the ability to transfer their balance to other users. It is advised to update the comment as per the implemented method.

In Contract TradableStaking, struct Stake has 4 variables in which 2nd and 3rd variables are 32 bytes whereasthe 4th variable size is 5 bytes contrary to comments. 

**Recommendation**: 

Update/Add the natspec comments for the above-mentioned contracts’ methods. 



### Redundant storage variable update

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TradableSettings, the method activateTradingFeeTier is using storage for `selectedTier` variable, which updates the state of the `tradingFeeTierMap` map. There is no need for the last line in the method logic.

tradingFeeTierMap[price] = selectedTier;

It is also the same for the method `deactivateTradingFeeTier` in the TradableSettings contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the redundant state update statement.



### Inconsistent coding pattern in Tradable Settings

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The internal function sendMessage() of Tradeable Settings contract is used only in some places, while in other places the complete function is written instead of calling it internally.. It can also be used on lines: 503, 510 and 517

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to use the sendMessage internal function at all places or use the function definition so that the coding pattern is consistent.
