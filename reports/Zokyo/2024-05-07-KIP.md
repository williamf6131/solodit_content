# Findings

## Low Risk

### Centralization Risk

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Description**

All the privileges to update system's critical state (setting sale configs and enabling transfers) lies with the owner's address. It should be ensured that the owner key is a multisig with a timelock in order to reduce the centralization of power to one address. 

**Recommendation**:

Ensure that the owner key is a multisig with a timelock.
Client comment: Regarding the multisig, that aligns with our plans - we will be doing this at launch.

## Informational

### Floating Pragma

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

The contract uses a floating pragma â†’
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
```



It allows compiling the contract with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.
