### Arbitrary Address Supplied to executeSwap of the TeaVaultAmbient Contract Allows the Pool Manager to Drain the Pool Resulting in a Theft of Funds

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: TeaVaultAmbient.sol#executeSwap

**Description**: 

The TeaVaultAmbient contract is a wrapper around the Ambient swap dex which allows funds to be deposited by users where these funds are managed by the pool manager actor who has the authority to add liquidity to a strategy and perform swaps on behalf of the user. The executeSwap function allows the pool manager to execute a swap from any router via the swap relayer. This function takes an address (swap router), however, the address supplied to the function can be a malicious contract which will allow the pool manager to extract funds from the contract by paying well under market rates bypassing the validation against baselineValue. 
Consider the proof of concept secret gist below where a user deposits ETH into the contract and the pool manager proceeds to extract $23,577 USD (at the time of writing) worth of ETH in exchange for ~$5,000 DAI:
https://gist.github.com/chris-zokyo/0458e8bf019f1143211322b937a3aee6 
A flashloan may allow the attacker to steal funds from vaults with significantly more value. 

**Recommendation**

Restrict the _swapRouter parameter to a whitelist of trusted and verified swap router addresses in the form of a mapping set by protocol admins. In addition to this, implement strict validation on the swap data and consider integrating with well-known and audited decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to prevent misuse.



### _fractionOfShares Function in TeaVaultAmbient Contract May Cause the Vault to Round in the Incorrect Direction During Mathematical Operations

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: TeaVaultAmbient.sol#_fractionOfShares

**Description**: 

The _fractionOfShares function is used in the TeaVaultAbient contract to aid the distribution and pricing of vault shares. This function takes a boolean value where true indicates the intention to round up and false indicates the intention to round down. However, these operations are performed in an incorrect manner as mulDivRoundingUp is called when _isRoundingUp is false. This may cause the user to receive more and less shares than they deserve.

**Recommendation**

It’s recommended that this function is refactored to reflect the following to allow rounding in the correct direction:
```solidity
   function _fractionOfShares(
	uint256 _assetAmount,
	uint256 _shares,
	uint256 _totalShares,
	bool _isRoundingUp
  ) internal pure returns (
	uint256 amount
  ) {
	amount = _isRoundingUp ?
		_assetAmount.mulDivRoundingUp(_shares, _totalShares):
		_assetAmount.mulDiv(_shares, _totalShares);
   }
```


### Management Fee For The First Time Will Be Way Larger Than It Should Be

**Severity** - High

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**: 

In TeaVaultAmbient.sol, the lastCollectedManagementFee should be initialized as block.timestamp , if not when the management fee is accrued for the first time it will be accrued as →
```solidity
function _collectManagementFee() internal returns (uint256 collectedShares) {
        uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - lastCollectManagementFee;
        if (timeDiff > 0) {
            unchecked {
                uint256 feeTimesTimediff = feeConfig.managementFee * timeDiff;//10000 * td
                uint256 denominator = (
                    FEE_MULTIPLIER * SECONDS_IN_A_YEAR > feeTimesTimediff?
                        FEE_MULTIPLIER * SECONDS_IN_A_YEAR - feeTimesTimediff:
                        1
                );
                collectedShares = totalSupply().mulDivRoundingUp(feeTimesTimediff, denominator);
```
As you can see since on declaration lastCollectedManagementFee  would be 0 , the timeDiff for the first time would be block.timestamp - 0 which is block.timestamp meaning the fee would be way greater than what it should have been (should have been the timestamp difference when the vault was initialized to the current timestamp).

**Recommendation**:

Initialize the lastCollectedManagementFee to block.timestamp.

## Medium Risk

### Expected price can get manipulated so that swap functionality is denied everytime

**Severity**: Medium	

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

The function `executeSwap()` within the `TeamVaultAmbient.sol` contract, is used to swap tokens. One of the previous steps before `swap()`, is a call to `ambientImpact.calcImpact()` 
```solidity
(int128 token0Flow, int128 token1Flow, ) = ambientImpact.calcImpact(                      _token0,
           _token1,
           poolIdx,
           _zeroForOne,
           _zeroForOne,
           _maxPaidAmount.toUint128(),
           0,
           _zeroForOne ? type(uint128).max : 0     // when buying, priceLimit is upper bound
       );

```
This `calcImpact` works like a swap simulation, but without actually executing the swap. `calcImpact` returns `token0Flow` and `token1Flow` which is actually used to get the amount of tokens that are supposed to be returned as a swap result. 

This amount is later compared to the actual swapped amount. It is working like an slippage controller.
```solidity
if (receivedAmount < baselineAmount) revert WorseRate(baselineAmount, receivedAmount);
```

`receivedAmount`: The actual amount returned as a swap result from any router.
`baselineAmount`: The amount expected if the swap was executed on Ambient Finance’s pools.

This implementation can lead to the problem that if `receivedamount` is always less than `baselineAmount` then no swaps will be able to get executed. If would be a good idea if one of these was an input parameter and both were amounts from the same router, as it is done with `_minReceivedAmount`.

`baselineAmount` is the amount returned by `calcImpact` which is calculated on-chain, this means that it can get easily manipulated with a flashloan or having the enough funds to execute the manipulation. An attacker could front-run every swap transaction, manipulating this price in order to not allow any swap operation to be executed.
Even if it is not manipulated, if the pool from Ambient Finance becomes obsolete so that no funds are still on the pool, this price will always be lower than the actual one from other routers, this means that the swap will experience a denial of service.

**Recommendation**:

Do not rely on `calcImpact`. Better use an input variable the same way it has been done with `_minReceivedAmount`.

**Client comment**: The manager can use ambientSwap instead of executeSwap in this scenario. calcImpact is an approach to prevent minReceived from being set too low.

### Collecting management fees in setFeeConfig() can be exploited to dilute the shares of existing depositors

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

The admin can call the setFeeConfig() multiple times(even change it to max fees cap of 100%) and just keep accruing fees even when no new deposits happen. This is because on the line: 168 _collectManagementFee() is being called. This could be unfair for existing depositors as it would dilute their shares drastically.
It is also possible that the admin of the Vault can frontrun users and change the fee to 100% just before the user’s transaction occurs and charge a high fee without user’s notice.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to rethink on the need to _collectManagementFee() in setFeeConfig() and consider removing it. Also it is advised to use a mutlisig wallet with at least 3/5 configuration to decentralize the access to the administrative functions of the Vault.

### No `deadline` + `limitPrice` set to maximum can lead to loss of funds

**Severity**: Medium	

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

The function `ambientSwap()` within the `TeamVaultAmbient.sol` contract, which is used to swap tokens using Ambient Finance, does not implement a `deadline` parameter and hardcodes `limitPrice` to its maximum value.

No deadline: although a `_maxPaidAmount` and a `_minReceivedAmount` are passed to ambient, if a deadline control is not used, the swap could result in a worse price due to front-running displacement attacks.
The `limitPrice` is set to `uint128.max` if `_zeroForOne` is true and to `0` if it is false. `limitPrice` means the worst price the user is willing to pay on the margin. So, no having a correct control of limitPrice could result in swapping with a worse price.

The `deposit` and `withdraw` function neither implement a `deadline` parameter and check.

**Recommendation**:

Both mentioned issues should be fixed:
Add a `deadline` parameter and revert the transaction if it is executed after the deadline.
Add a `limitPrice` parameter to the `ambientSwap` function, which should be later encoded.

### Incorrect Order of Operations in TeaVaultAmbient Will Result In token1 to Never Be Deposited

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: TeaVaultAmbient.sol#deposit

**Description**: 

The deposit function of the TeaVaultAmbient allows a user to deposit into the protocol allowing their funds to be managed by a pool manager. This will let the pool manager deposit into strategies allowing the user to farm yield on their tokens after various fees are accounted for. The vault's first deposit will consider the amount sent of token0 in order to bootstrap the vault share’s totalSupply minting token at a rate of 1:1 dividing by the decimals multiplier stipulated by the pool owner. During subsequent deposits, the vault will consider the balance of the contract for both tokens in order to determine how many vault shares to issue in the following lines:
```solidity
               uint256 token0BalanceOfVault = _token0.getBalance(address(this)) - msg.value;
	 uint256 token1BalanceOfVault = _token1.getBalance(address(this)); 
	 _charge(_token0, _amount0Max);
	 _charge(_token1, _amount1Max);
```
The issue is that these orders of operations are incorrect as the balances for token1 will always be zero, as a result, the user will deposit token0 but never token1 as token1 will be entirely refunded during the refund process. This may cause certain functionalities of the vault to revert such as swapping token1 for token0 and providing liquidity to two token strategies significantly limiting what the pool manager can do.

**Recommendation**

It’s recommended that the vault reverses these orders of operations to first charge the user for token0 and token1 then obtain balances to distribute vault shares. The initial deposit logic will also need to be refactored in order to consider both token0 and token1.

**Client comment**: 

There may be some token1 in LPs held by the vault, and deposit takes both tokens based on the portion of LPs, because it adds liquidity to all open liquidity positions proportionally.

### Incompatibility with Fee-on-Transfer Tokens

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**:

The TeaVaultAmbient contract assumes that the amount of tokens transferred equals the amount specified in the transfer function calls. For tokens that implement a fee-on-transfer mechanism (i.e., deduct a fee during transfers), the actual amount received by the contract will be less than expected. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect accounting, miscalculations in share allocations, and potential losses for users.

**Recommendation**:

Modify the contract to handle tokens with fee-on-transfer behavior by implementing one of the following:
Asserting the actual amount of tokens received after each transfer and adjusting calculations accordingly.
Alternatively, enforce a restriction that only allows tokens without fee-on-transfer mechanisms by adding a validation step during initialization that rejects incompatible tokens.

**Client comment**: 

We choose to not support fee-on-transfer token. There does not seem to be a standard method to verify if an ERC20 token does this or not, so we will have to verify manually when creating a vault.


### The Manager Can Manipulate Position Liquidity at the Users Detriment

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**:

The manager has full control over adding and removing liquidity positions through the addLiquidity() and removeLiquidity() functions. The manager could manipulate these positions in ways that negatively impact users, such as:
Adding liquidity to illiquid or high-risk positions that are unlikely to generate returns.
Removing profitable liquidity positions before performance fees are calculated, reducing the vault's apparent gains.
Timing the addition
or removal of liquidity to coincide with user deposits or withdrawals, affecting the share value calculations to the detriment of users.

**Recommendation**:

Implement policies and mechanisms to align the manager's incentives with those of the users, such as:
Setting guidelines or limits on the types of positions the manager can enter.
Requiring a time delay or community approval for significant changes in liquidity positions.
Implementing performance metrics that reward the manager for positive outcomes and penalize negative ones.

**Client comment**: 

Acknowledged.This vault will be used by in-house strategy team. Time delay may not be practical because the market sometimes may change very rapidly. There is a performance fee for the manager. A vault is underperforming the TVL will be very low.

### Users May Accidentally Deposit into Malicious or Misconfigured Vaults

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

Since anyone can deploy a vault via the factory contract and assign themselves as the owner and manager, users might unknowingly deposit funds into vaults controlled by malicious actors. These actors could set high fees, manipulate liquidity positions, or perform other actions that result in losses for users.

**Recommendation**:

Establish a registry of verified and audited vaults that users can refer to when choosing where to deposit funds. Educate users on the risks of depositing into unverified vaults and encourage them to perform due diligence. Additionally, implement access controls or verification steps in the factory contract to limit the deployment of new vaults to trusted parties.


### The Decimal Multiplier Would Not Work For Tokens With > 18 Decimals

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Description**: 

The DECIMAL_MULTIPLIER has been used for tokens such as USDC with 6 decimals (non 18 decimal tokens) , the multiplier would be applied here →
```solidity
 if (totalShares == 0) {
            // vault is empty, default to 1:1 share to token0 ratio (offseted by _decimalOffset)
            depositedAmount0 = _shares / DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER;
```
So if token was USDC , DECIMAL_MULTIPLIER woud be 1e12 to normalize the deposited amount to 6 decimals . But if the token has say 22 decimals then the following would be incorrect cause in that case we would need to multiply by the DECIMAL_MULTIPLIER , for example we would have DECIMAL_MULTIPLIER as 1e4 and multiply shares with DECIMAL_MULTIPLIER to provide us with the correct value.

**Recommendation**:

Handle the case where tokens have > 18 decimals .

**Client comment**: 

There’s no hard constraints on the decimals of vaults, it’s controlled by decimals offset when initializing. If token0 has more than 18 decimal digits we can still use 0 or more for offset.

### Swap operation fails due to zero quantity in ambientSwap function

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: TeaVaultAmbient.sol

**Description**: 

In the ambientSwap function of the TeaVaultAmbient.sol contract, the _maxPaidAmount is set to zero in cases involving non-native token transfers to ensure the value passed is zero. However, this also sets the qty parameter of the userCmd function to zero, which results in a no-operation swap (outcome is (0, 0)). This essentially makes the swap ineffective.
```solidity
       // swap using Ambient pool
        bytes memory results = ambientSwapDex.userCmd{value:_maxPaidAmount}(
            paramsConfig.swapCallPath,
            abi.encode(
                token0,
                token1,
                poolIdx,
                _zeroForOne,
                _zeroForOne,
                _maxPaidAmount,   // @param qty
                0,
                _zeroForOne ? type(uint128).max : 0,     // when buying, priceLimit is upper bound
                _minReceivedAmount,
                0
            )
        );
```

**Recommendation**: 

To resolve this issue, separate the value passed to userCmd from the quantity of tokens being swapped. This can be done by properly setting the qty parameter even when _maxPaidAmount is zero. Ensure that _maxPaidAmount correctly represents the value passed for the transaction, while qty should represent the actual amount of tokens intended to be swapped.

### Approval residual issue in ambientSwap function

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: TeaVaultAmbient.sol

**Description**: 

The ambientSwap function in TeaVaultAmbient.sol approves a token amount of _maxPaidAmount to the ambientSwapDex but does not clear the residual allowance post swapping. This behavior can result in future calls to _src.approve(address(ambientSwapDex), _maxPaidAmount); failing for certain tokens, such as USDT, that do not allow non-zero approvals unless cleared. This can lead to unintended approval states and hinder the functionality of the swap mechanism.

**Recommendation**: 

It is recommended to set the approval to zero after the swap is executed to ensure that no residual approval amounts persist. This can be done by adding _src.approve(address(ambientSwapDex), 0); right after the swap is called. This ensures compatibility with tokens (e.g., USDT) that enforce zero approval before setting a new approval amount.

## Low Risk

### Unsanitized Token Symbol and Name May Allow an Attacker to Achieve Cross Site Scripting in the Front End

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: TeaVaultAmbientFactory.sol#createVault

**Description**: 

The TeaVaultAmbientFactory allows a pool owner to create a new vault taking two tokens allowing users to deposit into their vault to take advantage of the strategies offered. The token name and symbol for the vault are displayed in the frontend website, this could allow an attacker to inject javascript code to potentially achieve Cross Site Scripting (XSS). Arbitrary JavaScript code may result in the siphoning of user funds through the signing of malicious transactions and aid in phishing attempts. 

**Recommendation**

It’s recommended that the developers implement dompurify in their frontend to escape special characters which may be attempting to achieve Cross Site Scripting. 

### Missing __gap storage placeholder in upgradeable contracts

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: TeaVaultAmbientFactory.sol, TeaVaultAmbient.sol

**Description**: 

The contracts TeaVaultAmbientFactory and TeaVaultAmbient are upgradeable but lack the __gap storage variable, which is crucial for accommodating future storage changes without causing conflicts. This omission can lead to serious storage layout issues when upgrading the contracts, jeopardizing their functionality and security.

**Recommendation**: 

To mitigate potential storage conflicts in future upgrades, it is recommended to include a __gap storage variable in both TeaVaultAmbientFactory and TeaVaultAmbient. This variable should be an array of a fixed size, typically 50 slots, reserved for future storage variables. This allocation ensures that any new storage variables can be added in later versions of the contracts without disrupting the existing storage layout.

### Direct Token Transfers to Vault Can Mislead Users About Share Value

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The TeaVaultAmbient contract allows users to deposit tokens in exchange for shares representing their stake in the vault. However, users can directly transfer tokens to the vault contract without going through the deposit function. These direct transfers increase the vault's total assets without minting additional shares, artificially inflating the share price. This can mislead other users and create an illusion of higher vault performance or value.

**Scenario**:

Initial Deposit: A user deposits $1 worth of tokens into the vault via the deposit function and receives shares proportional to their deposit.
Direct Transfer: The same user then directly transfers an additional $1,000 worth of tokens to the vault contract without using the deposit function. This increases the vault's total assets but does not mint additional shares.
Inflated Share Price: The share price effectively doubles due to the increased assets without an increase in total shares. Users viewing the vault's statistics might see a high share price or performance, potentially misleading them into thinking the vault is more profitable than it is.
Withdrawal: When the user withdraws, they can only redeem assets proportional to their shares. The extra assets remain in the vault, benefiting all shareholders equally.

**Recommendation**:

Prevent Direct Transfers: Implement a mechanism to reject direct token transfers to the vault contract. This can be achieved by adding a fallback function that reverts any direct transfers by selfdestruct functions.
Adjust Share Price Calculations: Modify the share price calculation to exclude tokens received via direct transfers or to account for them properly.
UI Warnings: Update the user interface to warn users when the vault has a low TVL but a high share price, indicating that the share price may not be indicative of actual performance.
Mint Initial Token Shares To Zero Address: When the TeaVaultAmbient is initialized, consider minting a small amount of tokens to the zero address. This will bootstrap the totalSupply and make inflationary attacks extremely expensive to trigger.
Use of Virtual Accounting: The Aave v3.1 upgrade introduced virtual accounting to decrease the attack surface of their contracts which were using balanceOf. This ensures that such externally manipulatable functions no longer pose a risk to the contracts.

### Deployer Can Set Excessive Fees to Drain Funds From Unsuspecting users

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**:

In the initialize() function of the TeaVaultAmbient contract, the deployer can set the FEE_CAP parameter to a value just below FEE_MULTIPLIER (which is set to 1,000,000). This allows the owner to configure the feeConfig with excessively high fee percentages, up to 99.9999%. Specifically, the owner can set:
entryFee and exitFee such that their sum is less than or equal to FEE_CAP.
performanceFee up to FEE_CAP.
managementFee up to FEE_CAP.
By setting these fees to extremely high values, the owner can effectively drain funds from the vault through fees charged on deposits, withdrawals, performance gains, and management over time.

**Recommendation**:

Implement strict upper limits on all fee percentages that are hard-coded into the contract and cannot be exceeded, regardless of the FEE_CAP value. For example, set maximum allowable percentages for entryFee, exitFee, performanceFee, and managementFee (e.g., no more than 5%). This prevents the owner from setting excessive fees that could harm users.

**Client comment**: 

FEE_CAP is the cap of the various fees and it can’t be changed once initialized. Its purpose is to provide lesser flexibility on fees. A user may opt to avoid a vault with FEE_CAP higher than comfortable. We generally set FEE_CAP to 30%.

### Admin Fee Manipulation Combined with Front-Running Users' Transactions May Result in Overcharging of Fees

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The admin can exploit the setFeeConfig() function to manipulate fees right before users' transactions, effectively front-running users. By monitoring pending user transactions, the admin can increase fees, such as entry or exit fees, just before those transactions are confirmed. This combination of front-running and arbitrary fee increases can result in significantly higher costs for users or a reduction in the value of their withdrawals, making the system highly unfair and potentially harmful for users.

**Scenario**:

A user submits a transaction to deposit or withdraw funds from the vault.
The admin monitors the pending transaction and quickly increases the entry or exit fees by calling setFeeConfig() before the transaction is confirmed.
The user's transaction is processed with the new, higher fees, resulting in a significantly reduced deposit or withdrawal value.
The admin benefits from the increased fees, while users suffer from unexpected, higher costs without any warning.
Also the _collectManagementFee() is exhorbitantly high if deposit is made after large periods of time such as a month or over a month. This can misalign the economic incentives as for some reason if the Vault is uninteracted with for a long time, then a depositor would be discouraged from depositing first due to a high management fee. For example: Let's say that the totalsupply() of shares is 1000*10**18. Now let's say if the Vault is uninteracted with for 6 months(taking a longer time to illustrate impact but this can also be considered as 1 month), then let’s assume
managementFee = 1,000,000 
timeDiff = SECONDS_IN_A_YEAR / 2 = 15,768,000
Then,
FEE_MULTIPLIER * SECONDS_IN_A_YEAR = 1,000,000 * 31,536,000 = 31,536,000,000,000
denominator = 31,536,000,000,000 - 15,768,000,000,000 = 15,768,000,000,000
collectedShares = totalSupply().mulDivRoundingUp(feeTimesTimediff, denominator) 
                	    = 1000*10**18
Also note that for 1 month time difference the collected shares turns out to be approx 89*10**18 which is still significantly high.

**Recommendation**:

Implement a cooldown period between the time a fee change is requested and when it becomes effective. This prevents admins from making last-minute fee changes to front-run user transactions. Also consider lowering the cap of the management Fee in order to prevent the admin from setting Management fees as 100%


### Manager Can Manipulate Swaps to Cause Losses to the Vault

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**:

The manager has the ability to perform token swaps on behalf of the vault using the ambientSwap() and executeSwap() functions. There are insufficient checks to ensure that swaps are executed at fair market rates. The manager could intentionally execute swaps at unfavorable rates, causing significant losses to the vault. For instance, the manager might swap large amounts of tokens in illiquid pools or manipulate price slippage parameters to execute trades that are detrimental to the vault's value.

**Recommendation**:

It’s recommended that pool managers have a limited number of operations that they can perform per day in order to reduce risky transactions and promote thoughtfulness when performing such transactions. 

### Return values of _collectManagementFee() and _collectAllSwapFee() not consumed

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: TeaVaultAmbient.sol

**Description**: 

In the functions setFeeConfig(...), deposit(...), and withdraw(...) within TeaVaultAmbient.sol, the return values of the functions _collectManagementFee() and _collectAllSwapFee() are not being utilized or checked. This may result in overlooked fee collection statuses.

**Recommendation**: 

Evaluate the return values of _collectManagementFee() and _collectAllSwapFee() within the setFeeConfig(...), deposit(...), and withdraw(...) functions. Ensure that the results are properly checked and handled to confirm proper execution and to appropriately address potential unexpected values.	

**Client comment**: Returned values are included in events.

### Missing initialization call for PausableUpgradeable in initialize function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: TeaVaultAmbientFactory.sol

**Description**: 

The initialize(...) function in TeaVaultAmbientFactory.sol does not invoke the initialization function of the PausableUpgradeable contract. Given that TeaVaultAmbientFactory inherits from PausableUpgradeable, omitting this call may leave the PausableUpgradeable contract improperly initialized, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when attempting to pause or unpause the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

To resolve this issue, ensure that the initialize function calls the initializer function of the PausableUpgradeable contract. You can do this by adding __Pausable_init(); within the initialize function. This ensures that the inherited PausableUpgradeable contract is properly initialized.
 
### Insufficient Sanity Checks of Liquidity Parameters

**Severity**: Informational 

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**:

The addLiquidity() function relies on the manager to provide appropriate values for _tickLower, _tickUpper, and _liquidity. If the manager provides invalid or extreme values, it could result in failed transactions or unintended behavior. Additionally, there's a risk of rounding errors due to the adjustments made to the liquidity amount (roundUpX12Liquidity).

**Recommendation**:

Implement validation checks on the liquidity parameters provided by the manager. This could include:
Ensuring that _tickLower is less than _tickUpper.
Verifying that the _liquidity amount is within acceptable bounds.
Handling rounding adjustments carefully to prevent significant discrepancies.

**Client comment**: We left the checking of the parameters to Ambient’s contracts. They should revert if the parameters are incorrect.
