# Findings

## Medium Risk

###  Misuse of ecrecover

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

VotingEscrow.sol - Vulnerability exists in the signature logic of delegateBySig() function. According to the following:
```solidity
address signatory = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
require(signatory != address(0), "VotingEscrow::delegateBySig: invalid signature");
```
The contract retrieves the address of the signer from the signature via ecrecover() then the retrieved address is being ensured not to be zero address. This is insufficient because an arbitrary signature can also return an arbitrary address.
It is very unlikely for the attacker to exploit this in order to target one specific address by brute force (i.e. probability near zero). But attacker using brute force can be attempting to find just one address among a pool of addresses (i.e. owners of the NFTs). Once the attacker finds a signature that produces an address of any owner (along with the suitable nonce), the impact is big as they move all the delegates to a wallet that they choose.
The severity of the issue is not decided to be high because the strict equality required of nonces[signatory] limit the power of the attacker to carry out such an attempt successfully.

**Recommendation** 

The address of the owner (i.e. signer) should be involved in the digest. Refer to section How to implement EIP-712 in this posting.

### Missing VERSION in DOMAIN_TYPEHASH

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract VotingEscrow, the DOMAIN_TYPEHASH  is build as following
```solidity
bytes32 public constant DOMAIN_TYPEHASH =
       keccak256(
           "EIP712Domain(string name,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)"
       );
```
While the EIP712 states it has one more parameter  `string version` which is missing in this contract.
In the same contract, the delegateBySig method id uses `version` parameter to create the domain separator. This ambiguous behavior can result in an `Invalid signature` revert for any dapp/backend trying to create the legit signature.

**Recommendation**: 

Add `string version` in the DOMAIN_TYPEHASH	
```solidity
bytes32 public constant DOMAIN_TYPEHASH = keccak256("EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)");
 ```


### Centralization risk

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Admin enjoys much authority in contracts. The general theme is that admin has power to call several state changing functions also affecting the tokenomics of the project . Some functions can be highly severe to be left out controlled by one wallet .

**Recommendation** 

Implement a mutlisig contract as governor or utilize readily implemented mutlisig product.
 
## Low Risk

### Lack of events in admin functions

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Voter.sol/VotingEscrow.sol - Functions are supposed to be called by privileged wallets to change important parameters that run the protocol. It is advised to have such functions emit events describing the changes that took place. Among these functions:
In Voter
function setGovernor(address _governor) public 
function setEmergencyCouncil(address _council) public 
function whitelist(address _token) public 

In VotingEscrow
function setTeam(address _team) external 
function setArtProxy(address _proxy) external 
function unfreeze(uint256 _tokenId) external 
function batchUnfreeze(uint256[] memory _tokenIds) external 
function setVoter(address _voter) external 
function voting(uint256 _tokenId) external 
function abstain(uint256 _tokenId) external 
function attach(uint256 _tokenId) external 
function detach(uint256 _tokenId) external 

In Minter
function setEarlyGrowthParams(uint[] memory params) external
function setOverrideGrowthParam(uint param) external
function setTeam(address _team) external
function acceptTeam() external
function setTeamRate(address _teamRate) external
function setWeeklyOverride(address _weeklyOverride) external

**Recommendation** 

Emit events that describe the change that took place.


### Unsafe casting

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

VotingEscrow.sol - Casting values without validating the numbers to be within the valid range is commonly used in this contract and it is a discouraged pattern.
In _checkpoint()
int128(int256(new_locked.end - block.timestamp))

int128(int256(t_i - last_checkpoint))

In _deposit_for()
_locked.amount += int128(int256(_value));

In _balanceOfAtNFT()
997     upoint.bias -= upoint.slope * int128(int256(block_time - upoint.ts));

In _supply_at()
1047    last_point.bias -= last_point.slope * int128(int256(t_i - last_point.ts));

In _balanceOfNft()
934     last_point.bias -= last_point.slope * int128(int256(_t) - int256(last_point.ts));
935     if (last_point.bias < 0) {
936         last_point.bias = 0;
937     }
938     return uint(int256(last_point.bias));

In withdraw()
uint value = uint(int256(_locked.amount));

**Recommendation** 

Implement a SafeCast functionality similar to this library: SafeCast


### Using assert excessively

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

VotingEscrow.sol - assert is being utilized unnecessarily in this contract despite that it is meant to be used for a different purpose. The assert statement serves the purpose of testing for internal errors and validating invariants
The require function in Solidity should be utilized to verify the fulfillment of valid conditions, such as inputs or contract state variables, and to validate return values obtained from interactions with external contracts.
There are 13 occurences in which assert is being used in this contract in which almost all are considered a misuse. For the cases in which the developer sees as an invariant and should not be reached, assert can be used, otherwise it is advised to use require instead.

**Recommendation** 

Replace assert by require with an appropriate concise error message.

### Use _safeMint(...) instead of _mint(...)

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract VotingEscrow.sol, _mint(...) is used to mint NFTs to user addresses whereas it is advised to use _safeMint to ensure that the address is either an EOA or a contract that implements ERC721Receiver.

**Recommendation**

Use OpenZeppelin safeMint implementation for the ERC721 tokens.

### Use 2-step ownership transfers

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Contract Voting.sol and Contract VotingEscrow.sol have several setters which transfers important ownerships in one step. 
function setGovernor(address _governor); 
function setEmergencyCouncil(address _council);
function setTeam(address _team) external;

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to use 2-step ownership where the current owner nominates the next owner and the next owner has to accept it. 

### Transfer is unnecessarily triggered

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

VotingEscrow.sol - _transferFrom 
ExternalBribe.sol - _safeTransfer and _safeTransferFrom
Following functions does not validate that to is not the same address as from which result in triggering an unnecessary transfer process.
function _transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, address _sender) internal 
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external 
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes memory _data) public 
function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint256 value) internal
function _safeTransferFrom(address token, address from, address to, uint256 value) internal

**Recommendation** 

Need to make this validation in any of the transfer methods whether the external or internal ones.

### Missing checks for address(0) in setter methods

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract Voting.sol, the following methods are missing zero-address checks.

function initialize(address[] memory _tokens, address _minter) external;
This method does not check if _minter is a zero-address or not.

function setGovernor(address _governor); 
For setGoverner(), there is no check for zero-address for _governer parameter and the method checks that only the governor should be able to set a new governor. So, suppose accidentally governor is set as address(0). In that case, it will be impossible to set the governor again; all the methods callable only by the governor can not be called anymore.

function setEmergencyCouncil(address _council);
The above case of the setGovernor method applies to the setEmergencyCouncil method as well.

In contract VotingEscrow.sol, the following methods are missing zero-address checks:

function setTeam(address _team) external;
For setTeam(), there is no check for zero-address for _teamparameter and the method checks that only the team should be able to set a new team. So, suppose accidentally team is set as address(0). In that case, it will be impossible to set the team again; all the methods callable only by the team can not be called anymore.


function setArtProxy(address _proxy) external;
This method does not check if _proxy is zero-address or not.


In contract Voting.sol, the following methods are missing zero-address checks:

function setTeam(address _team) external;
There is no check for zero-address for _team parameter. 



**Recommendation**:

Add checks to revert in case zero-address parameters are passed in the above-mentioned scenarios.

### Missing length checks

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract Voter.sol, the method `claimBribes(address[] memory _bribes, address[][] memory _tokens,uint _tokenId) ` and in contract Minter.sol, the method initializeToken(address[] memory targets, uint[] memory accounts) have two array parameters that are accessed in the for loop and it is missing a check to see if both arrays are of same lengths.



**Recommendation**:

Add a validation check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the arrays have the same length.

### Insufficient validation in Minter.mintFrozen function can leads to escrowed token supply exceeding main token supply


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

The mintFrozen function in Minter contract enables users with team privileges to mint arbitrary amounts of escrowed tokens (ve) for multiple claimants. However, the function lacks proper validation to prevent the total supply of escrowed tokens from exceeding the total supply of main tokens (vs). If the total supply of escrowed tokens exceeds the balance of main tokens, the circulating_supply function, which calculates the circulating supply by subtracting the total supply of escrowed tokens from the total supply of main tokens, will revert. As a result, the period will not be updated since the update_period function relies on the circulating supply for its calculations.

**Recommendation**: 

Before minting escrowed tokens in the mintFrozen() function, perform a validation check to ensure that the total supply of escrowed tokens does not exceed the total supply of vs tokens.

## Informational

### Mismatching spec of NFT

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

VotingEscrow.sol - A natspec comment mismatches what the function actually does:
```solidity
/// @dev Returns the number of NFTs owned by `_owner`.
///      Throws if `_owner` is the zero address. NFTs assigned to the zero address are considered invalid.
/// @param _owner Address for whom to query the balance.
function _balance(address _owner) internal view returns (uint) {
    return ownerToNFTokenCount[_owner];
}
```

The comment which describes a spec is not actually implemented in the function.
/// Throws if `_owner` is the zero address. NFTs assigned to the zero address are considered invalid.

**Recommendation**

Implement the spec or if the spec is not needed, remove the comment.

### Unreachable code in _reset()

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Voter.sol - In _reset() function we have:
```solidity
uint256 _votes = votes[_tokenId][_pool];
if (_votes != 0) {
    _updateFor(gauges[_pool]);
    weights[_pool] -= _votes;
    votes[_tokenId][_pool] -= _votes;
    if (_votes > 0) {
        IBribe(internal_bribes[gauges[_pool]])._withdraw(uint256(_votes), _tokenId);
        IBribe(external_bribes[gauges[_pool]])._withdraw(uint256(_votes), _tokenId);
        _totalWeight += _votes;
    } else {
        _totalWeight -= _votes;
    }
```

Where votes[_tokenId][_pool] and accordingly _votes are of type uint256. Since the value of _votes >= 0 , we end up having _totalWeight -= _votes; serving no purpose. The only case in which the code is reachable (i.e. at _votes == 0) the subtraction has no effect on _totalWeight.

**Recommendation** 

Developer might need to fix this in some way in case the subtraction of _votes is supposed to has an effect. In the case in which there is no need to subtract value of _votes then it is better to remove the unneeded line of code.

### Divide by zero

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Voter.sol - Variables being the divisor of division are not ensured to be non-zero.
In notifyRewardAmount() function
uint256 _ratio = amount * 1e18 / totalWeight; 

In _vote() function
uint256 _poolWeight = _weights[i] * _weight / _totalVoteWeight;

totalWeight represents a state of contract while _totalVoteWeight is derived from the arguments of the function and they can be holding zero value. Having the functions revert for invalid inputs or state as a shown reason makes it less time consuming to debug when the transaction is reverted.

**Recommendation** 

Require these values to be non-zero so that it reverts showing a clearer message about the error and devs know what kind of mitigation to work on.

### Array indexes input of functions are not validated

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Voter.sol - Indexes by array are not ensured to be within the valid range. Arguments of function updateForRange(): start, end are not assured to be within the valid range of pools array.
```solidity
function updateForRange(uint start, uint end) public {
    for (uint i = start; i < end; i++) {
        _updateFor(gauges[pools[i]]);
    }
}
```
also,
```solidity
function distribute(uint start, uint finish) public {
    for (uint x = start; x < finish; x++) {
        distribute(gauges[pools[x]]);
    }
}
```

Having the function revert for invalid inputs as a shown reason makes it less time consuming to debug when the transaction is reverted.

**Recommendation** 

Require that end > start and that end <= pools.length .


### Use solidity time units 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract VotingEscrow.sol, MAXTIME, and iMAXTIME can use time units for readability instead.
```solidity
 uint internal constant MAXTIME = 365 * 86400;
   int128 internal constant iMAXTIME = 365 * 86400;
```

**Recommendation**: 

Use time units for MAXTIME, and iMAXTIME values


### Redundant validation in emission override check function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

The Minter.emission_override_enabled function is used to check if the emission override feature is enabled. It verifies three conditions: the current timestamp is less than _launchTime + OVERRIDE_ALLOWED_DURATION, weeklyOverride is greater than 0, and weeklyOverride is less than weekly. However, the third condition is redundant as the setWeeklyOverride function ensures that the new setted weeklyOverride value is less than the current weekly value.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove redundant check. 

### Unused imports

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

The code base contains unused imports not referenced in the contracts that should be removed to improve code cleanliness and eliminate unnecessary dependencies.
Voter.sol:
import 'contracts/libraries/Math.sol';

ExternalBribe.sol:
import 'contracts/interfaces/IGauge.sol';


**Recommendation**: 

Remove the mentioned imports.
