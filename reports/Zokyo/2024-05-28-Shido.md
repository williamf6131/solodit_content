# Findings

## High Risk

### Insufficient Src Validation allows Malicious Users To Steal WSHIDO From Users With Zero Allowance

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The WSHIDO token is forked from the WETH contract on the Ethereum Mainnet and is intended to allow users to wrap SHIDO to be used in the ecosystem. In the `transferFrom` function, there is a check which ensures that if src address is not equal to the `msg.sender` and the allowance is not equal to zero, deduct from allowance. After this check with no conditions, deduct from the src address and add to the dst address which both variables are user supplied and is where the issue lies. As a result, free token transfers can be made from users with zero allowance.

**Recommendation**: 

It’s recommended that the `transferFrom` method for the WSHIDO contract is refactored to include logic to account for the src address being the `msg.sender` and deduct amounts accordingly. 
 
## Medium Risk

### Deprecated Native Token Transfer Method Used In Withdraw May Cause Reverts

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `withdraw()` method is used by the WSHIDO contract in order to unwrap native tokens and which uses `payable(*).transfer(wad)` to transfer the originally deposited amount to the user. The original transfer method uses a fixed stipend of 2,300 gas units which may not be sufficient for some contracts to process the transfer resulting in a revert, preventing the receiving of funds.

**Recommendation**: 

It’s recommended that a low level `.call()` is used to transfer Ether between contracts and EOAs.

## Informational

### Use Constant and Immutable to reduce smart contracts gas cost

**Severity**: Gas/Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The WSHIDO smart contract utilizes state variables name, symbol, and decimals which are initialized at deployment and remain unchanged thereafter. These variables are currently declared without the constant keyword, resulting in unnecessary gas costs when these variables are accessed during transactions.

**Recommendation**: 

Convert the name, symbol, and decimals variables to constants by declaring them with the constant keyword. This change will embed these variables into the bytecode, eliminating the need for storage operations and reducing gas costs associated with accessing these values.

### Addition of Reentrancy Guards

**Severity**: Informational

**Staus**: Resolved

**Description**

Functions such as withdraw are susceptible to reentrancy attacks, where recursive calls can lead to unexpected behaviors and potentially harmful consequences. These functions also tend to consume more gas due to the nature of such attacks.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement reentrancy guards to minimize the risks associated with reentrant calls. In addition to this, reentrancy guards will also assist in managing the gas costs by preventing multiple unwarranted executions of expensive state changes.

**Hacker’s Notes (Informational)**

The WSHIDO has been forked directly from the WETH code deployed on the Ethereum mainnet to cater to Shido’s requirement of wrapping tokens. Developers should exercise caution when attempting to fork code from older code bases as there may have been breaking changes in the relative technologies since the code was written, for instance, the over/underflow checks added to the solidity compiler post 0.8 updates which required changes to the approval clause in transferFrom function. For this reason, we recommend that the WSHIDO code is refactored to suit the current landscape of Defi and implement ERC20 with added receive(), deposit(), and withdraw() functions. In addition to this, further changes to the totalSupply function will have to be made to consider the current balance of native tokens within the contract. For this reason, the token will fully comply with the ERC20 standards in addition to the gas optimizations made within the inherited contract. In addition to this, it may help with code size reduction in the main contract maintaining readability of the code.
Finally, the development team is to be commended for forking the liquidity pool source code directly from Uniswap V3 with minimal changes as the Uniswap V3 source code is a proven, battle tested code base which has withstood the test of time in the ever changing landscape of Defi and it’s threats.

**Post Fix Hacker’s Notes**

The updates to the WSHIDO contract seemed to have prevented the exploit to steal WSHIDO from other users with a zero allowance. It can also be noted that an initial owner was added as a constructor variable. The developers should be made aware as (informational ie. no security implications) that this initial owner value is somewhat redundant as there are no special powers or settings that the owner can do compared to other users.
