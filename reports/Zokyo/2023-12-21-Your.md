# Findings

## Low Risk


###  No address(0) check

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract YourToken.sol, the constructor has 2 params (defaultAdmin and initialOwner) that are not validated for address(0). If accidentally initialOwner is passed as address(0) then 1 billion tokens will be minted to address(0).

In Contract YourToken.sol, the method mint(...) mints tokens to address `to` which is not validated for address(0).

**Recommendation**: 

Add `require` statements to ensure these parameters are not `address(0)`.

## Informational

### Floating pragma

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Audited contracts use the following floating pragma:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
```
It allows to compile contracts with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.
