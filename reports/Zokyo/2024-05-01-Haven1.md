# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Unrestricted slippage tolerance

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: StaderHavenStakingManager.sol

**Description**

When depositing and withdrawing assets in exchange of different asset (funcitons `deposit()` and `requestWithdraw()`), slippage tolerance provides a protection mechanism in case of flash moves in the asset values. It is the responsibility of the user to provide the minimum amount of tokens he accepts and it is the responsibility of the protocol to provide this functionality for the user. In this protocol, function `deposit()` accepts native coin from the user to mint an amount `hsETHToMint` of `hsETH` to `msg.sender` (i.e. user). The amount `hsETHToMint` depends on the result of calculations from `getLastStoredHsETHToETHxRate()` as well as the outcome from an external interaciton with `StaderStakePoolManager`. It is recommended that the user is capable to provide a minimum amount of `hsETH` which they can accept.

**Recommendation** 

Provide slippage tolerance as a user parameter for both functions `deposit()` and `requestWithdraw()`. 

**Fix** - Issue addressed in commit 4e463de , fixed for function `deposit ()`  while the fix suggested for function `requestWithdraw()` does not address the issue. 

## Low Risk

### Lack of ERC20 Token Transfer Validation

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: StaderHavenStakingManager.sol

**Description**

Function `withdrawProtocolFees()` initiates ERC20 token transfers without validating the return value of the transfer operation or utilizing SafeERC20. This oversight can result in unhandled transfer failures, compromising the contract's functionality and exposing it to potential vulnerabilities.

```solidity
   function withdrawProtocolFees() external onlyRole(MANAGER) {
        computeLatestProtocolFees();
        IERC20Upgradeable(staderConfig.getETHxToken()).transfer(treasury, lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount);
        emit WithdrawnProtocolFees(treasury, lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount);
        lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount = 0;
    }
```
**Risks**: Unintended Consequences: Failing to validate token transfers may lead to unhandled failures, causing unintended consequences in contract state and potentially resulting in financial losses.

**Recommendation** 

To ensure secure and reliable ERC20 token transfers, it is recommended to use SafeERC20 Library to ensure safe and reliable token transfers, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities associated with ERC20 token handling.

### Unrestricted Token Approval

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: StaderHavenStakingManager.sol

**Description**

The smart contract includes a function called `maxApproveETHx` which approves the maximum amount of tokens to be transferred to an external contract, `StaderUserWithdrawManager`. This approval is made without any limit, effectively allowing the external contract to make unlimited ERC20 transfers to the contract's ETHx token. Since the `StaderUserWithdrawManager` contract is outside the scope of the audit, the contract's trustworthiness cannot be verified.
```solidity
   function maxApproveETHx() external onlyRole(MANAGER) {
        address userWithdrawalManager = staderConfig.getUserWithdrawManager();
        if (userWithdrawalManager == address(0)) {
            revert ZeroAddress();
        }
        ERC20Upgradeable(staderConfig.getETHxToken()).approve(userWithdrawalManager, type(uint256).max);
    }
```

This unrestricted approval poses a potential risk of a Denial of Service (DoS) on functions such as `deposit` and `requestWithdraw`. These functions rely on the correct calculation of the `lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount`, which should be zeroed when the balance of `ETHx` is drained. If the external contract withdraws an amount of tokens, causing the lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount to become out of sync with the actual balance, functions utilizing this calculation may revert due to underflow, shown at line 127:
```solidity
127  (ERC20Upgradeable(staderConfig.getETHxToken()).balanceOf(address(this)) - lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount)
```

**Recommendation**

Given that the approval to `StaderUserWithdrawManager` is only necessary for the `withdrawProtocolFees` function, specifically at line 97 where requestWithdraw is called:
```solidity
97      uint256 requestID = IStaderUserWithdrawManager(staderConfig.getUserWithdrawManager()).requestWithdraw(
            ethXShareToBurn, msg.sender, "Haven1"
        );
```



it is recommended to modify the `maxApproveETHx` function. Instead of approving the maximum amount of tokens, approve only the specific amount required for the `ethXShareToBurn` in the `withdrawProtocolFees` function. This targeted approval minimizes the risk associated with unlimited token approvals while still allowing the necessary functionality.


## Informational

### Checks-Effects-Interactions Violation in `withdrawProtocolFees` Function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: StaderHavenStakingManager.sol

**Description**

The `withdrawProtocolFees` function in `StaderHavenStakingManager` contract does not adhere the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern, a standard practice in Solidity development. In this pattern, checks are performed first, followed by state changes (i.e. includes even events), and finally external interactions.

However, in this function, the external interaction to transfer protocol fees to the treasury address is executed before resetting the `lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount` variable to zero. This sequence of operations violates the CEI pattern.

**Recommendation**

To ensure adherence to best practices and mitigate potential risks associated with the CEI pattern, it is advised to reorder the operations within the `withdrawProtocolFees` function. First, set `lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount` to zero to update the contract state, and then perform the external interaction to transfer protocol fees. This sequence will help maintain consistency and reduce the likelihood of reentrancy attacks or other vulnerabilities.
```solidity
   function withdrawProtocolFees() external onlyRole(MANAGER) {
        computeLatestProtocolFees();
        IERC20Upgradeable(staderConfig.getETHxToken()).transfer(treasury, lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount);
        emit WithdrawnProtocolFees(treasury, lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount);
        lastStoredProtocolFeesAmount = 0;
    }
```
### Inconsistent Pause Behavior Affecting Contract Operations

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: StaderHavenStakingManager.sol

**Description**:

The `StaderHavenStakingManager` contract utilizes the `PausableUpgradeable` pattern for halting operations in case of an emergency. A critical observation within the contract's design is the selective application of the `whenNotPaused` modifier, particularly on the `computeLatestProtocolFees` function. This function is pivotal for calculating protocol fees based on the exchange rate changes of the `ETHx` token. However, other key functions like deposit and `requestWithdraw` that indirectly rely on `computeLatestProtocolFees` for accurate financial calculations do not have direct pause restrictions.

In scenarios where the contract is paused due to an emergency (using the `pause()` function), `computeLatestProtocolFees` will be inoperative. However, functions like `deposit` and `requestWithdraw` can still be called, attempting to execute `computeLatestProtocolFees` indirectly. Since `computeLatestProtocolFees` will fail to execute in a paused state, any operation dependent on the latest protocol fee computation may proceed with outdated or Users will affect with inaccessibility to withdrawal of their funds 

**Recommendation**:

1) **Direct Pause Check**: Implement direct checks for the contract's paused state in functions that indirectly depend on `computeLatestProtocolFees`. This would ensure that any function requiring up-to-date fee calculations is halted or handles the pause state appropriately.
2) **Alternative Fee Handling**: For functions like deposit and requestWithdraw, introduce an alternative mechanism to handle fee calculations or state changes that doesn't rely on computeLatestProtocolFees when the contract is paused. This could include using the last known fee calculations or a safer default mechanism to ensure operations can continue securely if necessary.
3) **Comprehensive Pausing Strategy**: Review and possibly redesign the pausing strategy to ensure a coherent and comprehensive approach across the contract. This includes a clear definition of which operations should be allowed or prohibited during a paused state and ensuring that these rules are consistently applied.
