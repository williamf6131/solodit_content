# Findings

## Informational

### Visibility not declared

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: core/evm/iscmagic/ERC20BaseTokens.sol

**Constant**: MAX_UINT64

**Details**:

The constant doesn't have an explicit visibility declared. It will be set as public implicitly. To avoid unintended exposure, declare the visibility explicitly.

**Recommendation**:

Explicitly define the visibility

### Visibility not declared

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: core/evm/iscmagic/ERC20ExternalNativeTokens.sol

**Variable**: _nativeTokenID

**Details**:

The variable doesn't have an explicit visibility declared. It will be set as public implicitly. To avoid unintended exposure, declare the visibility explicitly.

**Recommendation**:

Explicitly define the visibility

### Mixed value and pointer receivers

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: core/blocklog/events.go

**Type**: EventLookupKey

**Details**:

Mixing value and pointer receivers for methods on a single type in Go can lead to confusion and potential issues.

**Recommendation**:

Use either value or pointer receivers for all methods on a type. This improves code clarity and avoids unintended behavior.

### Mixed value and pointer receivers

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: core/blocklog/receipt.go

**Type**: RequestLookupKey

**Details**:

Mixing value and pointer receivers for methods on a single type in Go can lead to confusion and potential issues.

**Recommendation**:

Use either value or pointer receivers for all methods on a type. This improves code clarity and avoids unintended behavior.

### Use of a deprecated function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: core/evm/evmtest/contractInstance.go

**Function**: types.NewTransaction

**Details**:

The "buildEthTx" function calls to a "types.NewTransaction" function, which is deprecated, and it is recommended to use the "NewTx" function instead.

**Recommendation**:

Don't use deprecated functions. Switch to use the NewTx instead of NewTransaction

### Use of a deprecated function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**File**: core/evm/evmimpl/impl.go

**Function**: types.NewTransaction

**Details**:

The "newL1Deposit" function calls to a "types.NewTransaction" function, which is deprecated, and it is recommended to use the "NewTx" function instead.

**Recommendation**:

Don't use deprecated functions. Switch to use the NewTx instead of NewTransaction
