# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Wrong Guard Function.

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

ERC20Distribution.sol -  In the  purchaseTokens 
assert() function was used to check the rate and balance or token. But rate and balance were calculated by parameters, so these checks can be false. assert() is used to check for code that should never be false, the role of assert() is to declare statements that you think will always hold. When an assent() statement fails, something very wrong and unexpected has happened, and you need to fix your code. Also, users can lose all gas when transaction fails by assert(), if it fails by require, the gas that was not used up to that moment will be reimbursed.

**Recommendation**: 

Use require()  instead of assert().

## Low Risk

### Unnecessary operation.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

ERC20Distribution.sol -  In the startDistribution there is a check to ensure that the contract balance of the distributed token and the _total_distribution_balance are the same. However, the next operation assigns the contract balance of the distributed token to the _total_distribution_balance, this makes the logic to be redundant. 

**Recommendation**: 

Remove this line.




### Gas optimization.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

ERC20Distribution.sol -  In the claimFiatToken, The result of the transfering _fiat_token is boolean. So there is no need to compare with true, It will cause more gas consumption. 
.

**Recommendation**:

## Informational

### Setter applied with no event emitted.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

ERC20Distribution.sol -  In the  changeKYCApprover
it is noticed that events are emitted after calling the setter methods in this contract. Recommendation: Add event emitter which emit new KYC approver address.
