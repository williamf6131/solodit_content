# Findings

## Low Risk

### The contract owner has too many permissions

**Description**

The vesting functionality is built based on token allocation performed by the contract owner. It
means only token owners can send vested tokens to token holders. The potential token
holders donâ€™t have any guarantees they receive these tokens. The function send can accept
each time another address. As the function is executed manually by the owner, there is a risk
to put the wrong holder address.

**Recommendation**:

Make vesting in a way to claim tokens by future holders, or implement lock up functionality
for automated unlock.

**Re-audit**:

The client marked it as expected logic. It was agreed that this was the approach we would take
and is not uncommon. Token holders have guarantees as per their SAFT agreements.
