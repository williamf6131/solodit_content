## Low Risk

### The issue associated with using upgradeable ERC20 contract

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

ERC20 token DevvE is upgradeable. This means the admin can in the future introduce new features and/or remove existing ones to the contract, which can impact the token holders. The severity of the impact will be subject to the changes introduced.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to not upgrade the contract often and use governance for upgrading it, or remove the upgradeability and use a fixed version of the ERC20 token.

## Informational

### Missing disable initializer

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

Contract DevvE.sol inherits the Intializable.sol and implements the initialize(...) method with the initializer modifier without disabling the initializers for the implementation contract as recommended by OpenZeppelin here.

**Recommendation**: 

Disable the initializers for the implementation method, as suggested by OpenZeppelin here.
