# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Signature proof not including a domain separator

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

In `ERC20DistributionNative.sol` & `ERC20Distribution.sol` - Function `purchaseAllowed()`
posses the following risk: If a contract does not use a `domainSeparator` when verifying
signatures: bytes call data proof, it becomes susceptible to cross-domain attacks. An
attacker could potentially take a valid signature from one context (chain, address, ...) and
use it to perform unauthorized actions in a different context.

**Recommendation**:

See Definition of `domainSeparator` in `eip-712` and follow it to construct a secure proof.

**Fix**: Issue is addressed in commit `a356632` by adding the `chain.id` and contract address
information to function `hashForKYC()`. According to requirements specifications of the
project a full eip-712 spec is not needed.

### No access control in `startDistribution()`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

The initial state of the `ERC20Distribution.sol/ERC20DistributionNative.sol` is paused (reasons
are unclear, might be due to waiting for the kyc approver to be assigned first or some other
factors). Keeping in mind that the contract should be paused until the devs see fit, anyone
can call the `startDistribution()` function and unpause the system.

**Recommendation**:

Unpausing the contract should be done by a privileged role ideally.

## Low Risk

### Absence of SafeERC20 library in ERC20 asset transfers

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

The smart contracts under review do not incorporate the SafeERC20 library when
conducting ERC20 token transfers. This has a negative impact when the ERC20 involved in
the `transfer` does not return value. There exist older ERC20 that did not follow the
standard `transfer` function prototype and that leads to undesirable outcomes.

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to use `SafeERC20` library to undergo transfers of `ERC20` assets.

**Fix** - Issue resolved in commit cfaaac2.

## Informational

### Unnecessary redundant variable

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

`ERC20DistributionNative` - In function `purchaseTokens()` the variable `inittokenbalance`
is declared in order to reflect the ERC20 balance of the contract:
```solidity
uint256 inittokenbalance = _trusted_token.balanceOf(address(this));
```
but priorly `pool_balance` served that purpose and the values of both variables are the
same on the moment they are used:
```solidity
uint256 pool_balance = _trusted_token.balanceOf(address(this));
```

**Recommendation**:

Assign the quantity (i.e. ERC20 balance) once.

### Increased deployment cost due to extended error messages

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

A significant concern has been identified during the audit, specifically related to the
extensive use of detailed error messages within the smart contracts. While these detailed
error messages offer valuable insights, it's essential to note that they contribute to an
increase in the size of contracts. This, in turn, escalates deployment costs, which are paid in
gas and increase the chance of hitting the deployment size threshold.

One example:
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
require(
hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, _msgSender()),
"GainDAOToken: _msgSender() does not have the minter role"
);
_mint(to, amount);
}
```

**Recommendation**:

Use custom error objects (e.g. `error UnauthorizedMinter()`) or concise short error
codes as revert messages. This issue is shown in all contracts within scope that use
`require` statements.

### Sender identification discrepancy

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

An issue lies in the way the `_msgSender()` function is used within the smart contracts. The
`_msgSender()` function is part of the context abstract contract, and it is designed to provide
a way to determine the original sender of a message in a multi-contract system.

The concern here is that using `_msgSender()` to determine the sender of the function call
might not yield the intended result in the context of the contract. This inconsistency could
lead to unexpected behavior.

In summary, the issue is related to inconsistent usage of `msg.sender` and `_msgSender()`
across the contracts. The coding style and usage of these variables need to be aligned for
clarity and correctness.

**Recommendation**:

To address this concern, developers should ensure that the same method is consistently
used to determine the sender across all contracts. Either use `msg.sender` consistently or
`_msgSender()` consistently, depending on the intended behavior.

**Fix-1**: The issue is partially addressed in commit a356632. All occurrences of `_msgSender()`
are being replaced by `msg.sender`. Issue is resolved in all contracts except in
`GainDAOToken` where both `_msgSender()` and `msg.sender` are being used together.

**Fix-2**:Issue fixed on commit cfaaac2


### claimNativeToken can be removed from `ERC20Distribution.sol`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

The `ERC20Distribution` contract uses a fiat token (ERC20) to purchase gain tokens, ETH
cannot be received by this contract (unless forced sent vie self-destruct), therefore the
function `claimNativeToken` is unnecessary since there can never be ETH in the contract.

Recommendation:

`claimNativeToken` should be removed from `ERC20Distribution.sol`

### Inconsistency between rate calculation and comment in `ERC20DistributionNative`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

In the `currentRateUndivided` function in `ERC20DistributionNative` contract, the
`_current_distributed_balance` increases after each call to `purchaseTokens`, so the `offset_e18`
(which is `_total_distribution_balance - _current_distributed_balance`) decreases. This
calculation causes the current rate to decrease as well, assuming that all other variables
remain constant during the single distribution. However, the comment suggests that the rate
should be ascending, i.e., it should increase as `_current_distributed_balance` increases. In
this implementation, the opposite happens: the rate decreases as
`_current_distributed_balance increases`, which is contrary to the intended "ascending
fractional linear rate" behavior.

**Recommendation**:

Use the adjusted formula or change the mentioned comment.

**Client comment**: This issue is by design.

### Comments For ERC20Distribution and ERC20DistributionNative are the same

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

There are instances in the `ERC20Distribution` contract where the comments correspond to
the `ERC20DistributionNative`, such as comments L272 and L273, they mention ether while it
should be the fiat token.

**Recommendation**:

The comments should be corrected.
