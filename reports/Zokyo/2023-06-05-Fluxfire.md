# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Function destruct in HappyTokenPool contract does not reset pool's Packed3 struct fields and also does not set pool's claimed variable to true. 

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged


**Description**: 

This allows a user to be able to call the claim function even when the pool is destructed. The claim function validates fields of Packed3 struct, failure to update the fields of the struct together with the pool’s SwapStatus struct’s claimed field upon function destruct call leaves users to still be able to call claimed function.

**Recommendations**:

To fix this problem, the pool’s packed3 fields should be updated accordingly as part of this function’s call. issue 1: Since

**Comment**: Since client says it’s by design which I also thought as much but needed to mention just in case it’s not intentional. 

## Low Risk

### Function claim() in HappyTokenPool, does not update pool’s  pool.swapped_map[msg.sender].

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

The function does not update the pool.swapped_map[msg.sender]  value after getting it value at “uint256 claimed_amount = pool.swapped_map[msg.sender]”
Even though the claimed status is updated thus “pool.swap_status[msg.sender].claimed = true;”  which prevents further claims but it is also advisable to reset the swapped_map value after claim.

**Recommendations**:

Update the variable after the claim is successful.

 Pool.swapped_map[msg.sender] = 0;
 
**Comment**:  Yes, resetting only swap_status maps would save gas instead of resetting both maps but it was worth mentioning because the amount was already sent to the caller so resetting it to zero would be a good practice not necessarily a security issue.

### Function initialize() in HappyTokenPool should be restricted to contract owner or creator.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

The function has no restriction as to who can call it. Because this function sets up some key information, this can lead to unexpected values set if it is not restricted to the owner or creator.

**Recommendations**: 

Since this function initializes some important contract information, it is recommended that it is restricted to only the contract creator.

**Comment**: 

Since the contract would be deployed using the proxy pattern this issue is not an issue.

## Informational

### Function swap() sends ether, it is recommended that you add openzeppelin’s reentrancy guard to prevent any possible reentrancy attacks.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Recommendation**:

Add openzeppelin reentrancy guard library to this function.

### The code line  msg.sender == pool.creator repeated in different functions in HappyTokenPool contract should be abstracted into a modifier to save gas and also make it easily reusable.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved


**Description**: 

The line of code stated above could be moved into a custom modifier, to make it reusable and then also save gas instead of implementing it in the body of the function.
