### `LiquidityFreeLaunch` Contract Will Never Finalize a Free Launch Due to Incorrect Order of Operations for `isFinalized` and `factory.getPair()`

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `LiquidityFreeLaunch` contract is responsible for handling the bootstrapping and sales of the newly created `DegenERC20` token. Should the maximum ETH to be raised be met, purchases are processed through the `performFinalTrade()` in order to finalize the contract and release the tokens into Pancakeswap. The issue lies in `_sendToDex()` where the current order of operations are the following:

1. Get Pair
2. Add Liquidity to Dex
3. isFinalized is set to true

This will cause the contract to never be finalized resulting in a revert for two reasons. The first is that the memory variable `pair` is obtained before the pool creation (`addLiquidity` will first check if a pool exists and create one if the zero address is returned), so the `lpToken` being transferred to the dead address will result in address zero. The second reason the contract will never finalize is because finalization is set only after `_sendToDex()` is finished executing - that is, we require finalization to be set to true before adding liquidity or else the transfer of tokens will revert.




**Scenario**

1. Attempt to Finalize:
    - When the `_performFinalTrade` function is called, it attempts to finalize the contract by sending the remaining tokens to the DEX.
    - The `_sendToDex` function is called to create a liquidity pool on PancakeSwap and add liquidity.
    - The contract tries to retrieve the pair address using `factory.getPair` before calling `router.addLiquidityETH`.
    - Since the pair does not exist yet, `factory.getPair` returns an address of zero.
    - This causes the subsequent LP token transfer to the dead address to fail, preventing the contract from being finalized.
    
2. Implications:
    - Users can never transfer or sell their acquired tokens because the contract is never finalized.
    - The `DegenERC20` token contract has a condition that restricts transfers until the sale is finalized, rendering the tokens useless.
    
**Recommendation**: 

It’s recommended that the order of operations for finalizing a free launch is refactored to the following for the `_sendToDex()` function:

### The owner can use the `burn` function to burn tokens from any address

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: DegenERC20.sol

**Description**

The `burn()` function allows the owner to burn tokens from any account. This can lead to misuse by malicious owners and can lead to wiping out millions in value from unsuspecting users holding the `DegenERC20` tokens. 
For example, let’s assume that Alice is the owner of the contract. And Bob holds 10 Million Degen tokens. For some reason, Alice decides to burn all the tokens of Bob. Now it may seem that Bob’s permission would be first required to burn these tokens or that it would be needed that Bob first transfers these tokens to the contract and then it gets burned. But nothing of that sort happens. Alice swiftly uses the burn function and burns all the 10 million tokens from Bob’s address resulting in significant loss for Bob. Not just this, Alice can burn any token from any user at any given point of time.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to add a modifier or a require check to ensure that only the user can burn the tokens himself using the burn function. Or add a mechanism such that the user first has to transfer the tokens to the contract that needs to be burnt and then once the tokens have been transferred to the contract, the tokens are burned.

**Comments**: The burn function has been removed from the codebase altogether. 







## Medium Risk

### Incorrect Fee Handling in `Purchase` Function

**Severity**: Medium

**Status** : Resolved  

**Description**: 

The purchase function contains a flaw in the `fee` calculation logic that can cause the transaction to revert if the incorrect fee amount is sent. The fee is calculated based on the `_amountIn` value, and the contract expects the user to send the `amountInWithFee` which includes the base ETH amount plus the calculated fee. If the user sends an amount that does not precisely match the expected value, the transaction will fail, potentially leading to a denial of service for valid transactions.

**Scenario**:

1. A user calls the purchase function with `_amountIn = 1 ETH`.
2. The user sends msg.value = 1.009 ETH (instead of the expected 1.01 ETH).
3. The contract calculates the expected value as 1 ETH + 0.01 ETH = 1.01 ETH.
4. The require statement checks if msg.value (1.009 ETH) equals expectedValue (1.01 ETH), which fails and reverts the transaction.

**Recommendation**:

1. Adjust the fee calculation to ensure it is correctly handled and more tolerant to rounding issues.
2. Provide clear instructions to users on the required fee to avoid transaction reversion.
3. Consider adding logic to handle slight discrepancies in the sent fee amount to prevent denial of service.
   
**Client comment** : 

Our design intentionally requires the fee to be added on top of the ETH the user sends. Our dApp takes the user's desired input and converts it to 101% of its value using a BigInt operation, ensuring the fee is calculated accurately, similar to how Solidity handles this.

1. **Frontend dApp**: The dApp automatically calculates the total amount (base ETH amount + fee) and displays it to the user, ensuring they know the exact amount to send.
2. **Bots**: We will implement the same fee calculation logic in our bots, using fixed-point unsigned arithmetic to ensure consistent rounding with Solidity.

### Insufficient Validation of Token Name and Symbol in `LiquidityFreeLaunchFactory`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status** : Resolved  

**Description**:

The `LiquidityFreeLaunchFactory` contract allows the creation of new tokens with specified names and symbols without any validation to ensure uniqueness. This could lead to multiple tokens being created with the same name and symbol, causing the user to effectively be able to do a free launch once again for a token already launched. 

**Scenario**:

1. Token Creation with Duplicate Names/Symbols:
    - An attacker could create multiple tokens with the same name and symbol using the `createLiquidityFreeLaunch` function. This lack of validation could lead to confusion among users, who might mistake one token for another, potentially leading to financial loss or scams.
    - For instance, an attacker could create a token with the same name and symbol as a popular token, misleading users into buying or interacting with the wrong token.
2. Confusion and Potential Scams:
    - Users might unknowingly buy or trade a token with the same name and symbol as a legitimate token, thinking they are acquiring the legitimate token. This could be exploited by malicious actors to conduct scams or phishing attacks.
    - 
**Recommendation**:

Implement a registry or a mapping within the factory contract to keep track of token names and symbols that have already been used. Before creating a new token, check if the name and symbol are already registered.
**Client comment** : We acknowledge the concerns about duplicate token names/symbols and the potential for user confusion and scams. However, given our platform's focus on meme coins and frequent token relaunches, we will not implement further validations beyond limiting symbols to six characters. This decision aligns with our business model, despite the noted risks. We appreciate the feedback and will ensure symbols are restricted to mitigate XSS threats.
**Changelog** : capped the token symbol 6 characters

### Missing zero address checks

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: LiquidityFreeLaunch.sol and LiquidityFreeLaunchFactory.sol

**Description**:

In `LiquidityFreeLaunch.sol`, there is missing zero address check for token and `zapTreasury`. If set once, they cannot be changed as these are immutable variables. If these are incorrectly set to zero address, they cannot be changed in the contract.
In addition to this, in the `LiquidityFreeLaunchFactory.sol`, there is missing zero address check for the parameters of the constructor of router, curve and zapTreasury. 

**Recommendation**

It is advised to add the missing zero address checks for all the mentioned parameters for `LiquidityFreeLaunchFactory` as well as `LiquidityFreeLaunch`.

### Incorrect usage of `setPoolContract()` function can lead to Denial of Service

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: DegenERC20.sol

**Description**:

The `setPoolContract()` function can be used to change the `poolContract` address to a dummy address or an address that does not support the `ILiquidityFreeLaunch` interface. Doing this will lead to all transfers getting reverted due to the require statement and lead to potential Denial of Service for `DegenERC20` token holders.

**Recommendation**

It is advised that owner of the contract take due note of this scenario and take measures to decentralize the ownership of this contract by transferring its ownership to a multisig wallet like Safe with 2/3 or 3/5 configuration of signers at least. Doing so reduces chances of private key leaks which can lead to this issue too.

**Comments**: The client said that only a `DegenERC20` created by a LFL will be functional since the tokens are owned by the contract and not transferable unless to and from the pool contract (until DEX graduation). If someone makes their own outside of our ecosystem it wouldn't show up on our platform or be usable. Additionally once the `setPoolContract` is called we set the owner to be the LFL pool itself, which has no functionality inside it to access this function which is acceptable.





### Deprecated Native Token Transfer Method Used May Cause Reverts

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

There are various methods is used by the source code in order to transfer native tokens between users and other contracts which achieves this using the `payable(*).transfer(uint)` to transfer amounts to and from the user. The original transfer method uses a fixed stipend of 2,300 gas units which may not be sufficient for some contracts to process the transfer resulting in a revert, preventing the receiving of funds and processing the trade.

**Recommendation**: 

It’s recommended that a low level `.call()` is used to transfer Ether between contracts and EOAs.


## Low Risk

### Improvement in `OnlyOnePerBlock` Modifier

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**:

In the `LiquidityFreeLaunch.sol` The `onlyOnePerBlock` modifier attempts to mitigate flash loan attacks by restricting interactions to one per block. However, this approach is insufficient as sophisticated attackers could still exploit timing and block synchronization.

**Scenario**: An attacker could synchronize multiple transactions within the same block, exploiting the contract and potentially causing financial loss.

**Recommendation:**

Implement additional mechanisms to protect against flash loan attacks, such as time-based restrictions, price oracles, and additional validation checks.

### Use `Ownable2Step` instead of Ownable for `LiquidityFreeLaunchFactory`

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: LiquidityFreeLaunchFactory.sol

**Description**:

The `renounceOwnership()` function can be called accidentally by the owner leading to immediate renouncement of ownership to zero address after which any `onlyOwner` functions will not be callable which can be risky.

In addition to this, the `transferOwnership()` function in contract allows the current admin to transfer his privileges to another address. However, inside `transferOwnership()` , the `newOwner` is directly stored into the storage owner, after validating the `newOwner` is a non-zero address, and immediately overwrites the current owner. This can lead to cases where the admin has transferred ownership to an incorrect address and wants to revoke the transfer of ownership or in the cases where the current admin comes to know that the new admin has lost access to his account.

**Recommendation**

It is advised that
1. The Owner cannot call `renounceOwnership` without first transferring ownership to a  different address. Additionally, if a multi-signature wallet is utilized, executing the `renounceOwnership` method for two or more users should be confirmed. Alternatively, the Renounce Ownership functionality can be disabled by overriding it. 

2. It is advised to make ownership transfer a two-step process. This can be done by using Openzeppelin’s Ownable2Step instead of Ownable.

Refer- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol 
**Comments**: The client added `Ownable2Step` to the DegenERC20 contract, added appropriate steps to transfer ownership of the token to the factory contract and removed Ownable from factory contract.

### There is no incentive to seed new token resulting in the user being worse off

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**:

Users are able to freely create a new token launch via the `LiquidityFreeLaunchFactory` provided they provide less than the `MAX_SEED_FEE` but more than the `BASE_SEED_FEE`. As the user does not stand to gain any of the DegenERC20 token, they are left worse off after creating a new launch as they will have had to pay the seed fee to launch such a token.

**Recommendation**: 

It’s recommended that the seeder gets a small amount of the token deployed when they seed the launch.

## Informational

### The `purchase()` function uses an additional parameter

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: LiquidityFreeLaunch.sol

**Description**:

The function `purchase()` function uses `_amountIn` parameter to specify the amount of ETH to send via the function. But this can already be done by setting the `msg.value`. In addition to this, the function can be simplified by removing the `_amountIn` parameter and removing require check on line: 195. Also the `msg.value` can be used directly for the require check on line: 194.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to

- Use `msg.value` on line: 194 directly instead of using `amountIn`
- Remove `_amountIn` parameter from the function and the require check on line: 195


### Redundant checks in `LiquidityFreeLaunch`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: LiquidityFreeLaunch.sol

**Description**:

There exist redundant checks on line: 111 as follows:
```solidity
		require(msg.sender == creator, "Only creator can seed");
```
This require check is not needed as the function already uses the `onlyCreator` modifier which checks for the same thing.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to remove the redundant check on line: 111 in order to optimize and simplify the contract.


### When creating a new free launch via the `LiquidityFreeLaunchFactory` the `createLiquidityFreeLaunch` should return the token and `lfl` address for easy access to contract addresses

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Recommendation:**

It’s recommended that this function returns two addresses. The first being the `DegenERC20` token and the second being the `LiquidityFreeLaunch` contract address.


### Unnecessary logging statements throughout the contract

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Recommendation**: 

It’s recommended that logging statements and imports from hardhat or foundry referencing the console.sol library are removed pre deployment as these are no longer necessary in the post deployment lifecycle.
