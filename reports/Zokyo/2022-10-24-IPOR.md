# Findings

## Low Risk

### Multiple external calls are executed in same transaction 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

In contract MiltonInternal, at line 348, there’s an external call performed after another external call that queries the IPOR price oracle for the accruedIbtPrice. There are no checks for the returned value of the oracle, which can lead to undefined behavior if the oracle price feeds were not updated or the feeds are corrupted. In the current implementation, with the codebase of the Oracle being maintained by the IPOR team, this is not a problem. But given the oracle only defines an interface, and following discussions for the long-term goals of the oracle, this might change and the price feeds source might not be under the team’s control.

**Recommendation**: 

Refactor the flow such as the values returned by the oracle are taking into consideration the potential vulnerabilities mentioned above.


### Multiple external calls are executed in the same transaction

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract StrategyAave at line 74, there’s an external call performed that depends on another external call result. The first call retrieves the address of the lending pool for a certain asset and then queries the lending pool for its reserves data. Given the LendingPoolAddressProvider is a contract deployed by a 3rd party this could return invalid data and result in undefined behavior.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a require check for zero address before querying the Aave lending pool to prevent undefined behavior.


### Redundant usage of SafeMath

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract IvToken at line 13, there’s a using statement for uin256 involving SafeMath. Given all the contracts use Solidity 0.8.14 the SafeMath library is redundant, as in Solidity >=8.0.0 there can be no under/overflow.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the using statement for uin256 and the SafeMath library import.



## Informational

### Incorrect balance assertion

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged


**Description**

In contract MiltonInternal at line 328, in function _getAccruedBalance the liquidityPool balance is checked before returning the accruedBalance. The statement checks for greater than or equal to 0 balances, which is incorrect because for a 0 balance it would not revert.

**Recommendation**: 

Check the result returned by the function for the case when liquidityPool is 0 to avoid getting undefined behavior because of accruedBalance being 0.


### Incorrect balance assertion

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract Joseph at line 72, in function _calculateExchangeRate the balance is checked before calculating and returning the exchange rate. The statement checks for greater than or equal to 0 balances, which is incorrect because for a 0 balance it would not revert.

**Recommendation**: 

Check the result returned by the function for the case when balance is 0 to avoid getting undefined behavior because of exchangeRate being 0.


### Variable shadowing

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract MiltonStorage there are multiple instances of variable shadowing. It occurs in functions with named return types which are then redeclared inside the function body. It is present at lines 182, 203 and 235  

**Recommendation**: 

Remove duplicate declarations





### Logical operator gas optimization

**Severity**: Informational

In contracts above, for comparison between unsigned integers and the value 0  the “!=” operator was used. Based on the fact that all the variables are unsigned integers, comparison could be done with the ">” operator with the same result. Using the “>” operator the gas usage is 6x cheaper for this particular operation.

**Recommendation**: 

Replace all comparison operators “!=” with “>”, as is described above.
