# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Missing call to _disableInitializers

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The TokenEmissionsStrategy contracts are using the Initializable module and doesn’t have a constructor that calls _disableInitializers().  

An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the _disableInitializers() function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed, more information can be found here.

 **Recommendation**: 
 
 Consider calling _disableInitializers()in the constructor.


### Approve is Incompatible with Non-Standard ERC20 Tokens

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The approve function used in the contract is incompatible with some non-standard ERC20 tokens that do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard. For example, tokens like USDT on Ethereum return void instead of a success boolean, causing transactions to revert when interacting with these tokens. Additionally, some tokens require setting the allowance to 0 before a new approve call, and failing to do so results in the transaction reverting.
This incompatibility can lead to transaction failures when attempting to approve or interact with non-compliant tokens.

**Recommendation**: 

To handle non-standard ERC20 tokens, it is recommended to use OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 library and specifically implement the forceApprove() function. This approach ensures proper handling of non-compliant tokens by supporting cases where the approve function behaves differently or requires additional steps like resetting the allowance to zero.


### Missing gap to Avoid Storage Collisions

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The TokenEmissionsStrategy contract is intended to be an upgradeable smart contract, but do not have a __gap variable.
In upgradeable contracts, it's crucial to include a _gap to ensure that any additional storage variables added in future contract upgrades do not collide with existing storage variables. This is especially important when inheriting from multiple upgradeable contracts.

**Recommendation**: 

Include a _gap as the last storage variable to TokenEmissionsStrategy contract to reserve space for future storage variables and prevent storage collisions. This is a common practice to ensure compatibility and avoid issues when upgrading the contract in the future.


### Unchecked transfers return value

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

In the TokenEmissionsStrategy smart contract, ERC20 token transfers are performed using the transfer and transferFrom methods. These methods return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation, as per the ERC20 standard. However, the contract does not check these return values, which can lead to scenarios where token transfers fail.

**Recommendation**: 

Use SafeERC20 library from OpenZeppelin, which handles these inconsistencies and ensures compatibility.

## Low Risk

### Centralization Risk

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

The smart contracts grant significant control to the contract owners through several functions. This centralization poses a substantial risk, as it places considerable trust and control in a single entity. If the owner's private key is compromised, it could lead to catastrophic disruptions or malicious misuse of the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a multi-signature wallet for executing Owner functions. This requires multiple authorized signatures to approve critical actions, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.


### Lack of Two-Step Ownership Transfer 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

The TokenEmissionsStrategy contract does not implement a two-step process for transferring ownership. In its current state, ownership can be transferred in a single step, which can be risky as it could lead to accidental or malicious transfers of ownership without proper verification.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a two-step process for ownership transfer where the new owner must explicitly accept the ownership. It is advisable to use OpenZeppelin’s Ownable2Step.

### Owner can renounce ownership

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

The Ownable contracts includes a function named renounceOwnership() which can be used to remove the ownership of the contract. 
If this function is called on the TokenEmissionsStrategy contract, it will result in the contract becoming disowned. This would subsequently break functions of the token that rely on onlyOwner modifier.



 **Recommendation**: 
 
 override the function to disable its functionality, ensuring the contract cannot be disowned e.g.


### Missing Emergency Exit for Rewards Distribution

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**:

The TokenEmissionsStrategy contract allows the owner to perform an emergencyWithdrawal(), but there is no way to stop or pause rewards emissions in case of an emergency.

**Scenario**:

If there is an issue with the emissions process or a vulnerability is discovered, there is no way to halt the distribution of rewards, potentially leading to loss of funds.

**Recommendation**:

Implement a mechanism to pause or stop emissions in case of an emergency. For example, a pause() function controlled by the owner that stops rewards emissions temporarily until the issue is resolved.

## Informational

### Lack of Detailed Event Emissions for Critical Functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved 

**Description**:

Critical operations in TokenEmissionsStrategy contract such as notifying the EmissionManager and performing reward transfers do not emit detailed events. This makes it harder to track, audit, and monitor contract activities, particularly off-chain. In a situation where malicious activity occurs, it would be challenging to trace key operations without comprehensive logging.

**Scenario:**

A malicious actor abuses the contract's reward transfer function.
Without proper event logs, it becomes difficult to investigate the incident and determine the source of the vulnerability.

**Recommendation**:

Add detailed events for all key operations, such as:

Emissions being notified.
Reward transfers.
Whitelisting of addresses

### Time-based Emission Notification Manipulation

**Severity**: Informational 

**Status**: Unresolved 

**Description**:

The  TokenEmissionsStrategy contract restricts emissions by ensuring that the EmissionManager can only be notified once per day (24 hours), using the lastNotified[_reserve] mapping to track the time of the last notification. However, there is a 10-minute buffer (lastNotified[_reserve] + 1 days - 10 minutes) that could allow a malicious actor to game the system by notifying emissions slightly earlier than intended.

**Scenario:**

A malicious actor calls notifyEmissionManager() just within the 10-minute buffer before the 24-hour period expires.
The attacker can consistently notify emissions slightly earlier each day, creating an emission schedule that does not align with the intended timeframe.

**Recommendation:**
Remove the 10-minute buffer or reduce its size to ensure that emissions can only be notified after exactly 24 hours have passed.

 Replace:
 ```
lastNotified[_reserve] + 1 days - 10 minutes <= block.timestamp
```
With : 
```
lastNotified[_reserve] + 1 days <= block.timestamp
```


### Floating Pragma 


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

The smart contracts are using a floating pragma version (^0.8.0). Contracts should be deployed using the same compiler version and settings as were used during development and testing. Locking the pragma version helps ensure that contracts are not inadvertently deployed with a different compiler version.


**Recommendation**: 

Consider locking the pragma version to a specific, tested version to ensure consistent compilation and behavior of the smart contract.
