## High Risk

### Unauthorized Withdrawal of Staked ETH via `repayWithStakeToken` Function

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved


**Affected Function:** repayWithStakeToken

**Description: **

A critical vulnerability allowing attackers to withdraw ETH staked by other users without proper authorization. The function fails to verify the ownership of the stake ID (`stakeId`) before processing the repayment and unstaking process, enabling anyone who knows the `stakeId` and the required fee calculation to withdraw the full staked amount by paying only a fraction of its value.

**Impact**: 

Allows unauthorized withdrawal of staked ETH, leading to potential loss of funds for users.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

- Identify a target stake ID (`stakeId`) with a significant amount of staked ETH.
- Calculate the required fee to repay the stake based on the yield amount and the accumulated yield per staked token. This can be done using the formula provided in the bug description.
- Call the `repayWithStakeToken` function with the target `poolId`, `stakeId`, and the calculated fee as the transaction value.
- Observe that the full amount of ETH staked under the target `stakeId` is transferred to the attacker's address, while only the calculated fee is deducted.

**Expected Behavior**: 

The `repayWithStakeToken` function should verify that the caller (`msg.sender`) is the owner of the stake ID (`stakeId`) before allowing the repayment and unstaking process to proceed. This ensures that only the rightful owner can withdraw the staked ETH.

**Actual Behavior**: 

The function does not perform any ownership verification, allowing any user to withdraw ETH staked by others by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Recommendation**: 

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to add an ownership check at the beginning of the `repayWithStakeToken` function. The following line of code should be inserted to ensure that the caller is the owner of the stake:
```solidity
if (staking.user != msg.sender) revert NotStaker(staking.user);
```
This check will prevent unauthorized users from exploiting the function to withdraw staked ETH that does not belong to them.


### Possibility of griefing users via front-running


**Severity**: High

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The participate function in the `LockedStakingPools` contract allows users to contribute to a pool with a specified token and amount. This function updates the user's position and the total funded amount for the token. The vulnerability arises from the interaction between the participate function and the `_depositToken` internal function. Users must approve the contract to transfer tokens on their behalf before participation. 
An attacker can exploit this by front-running a legitimate participation transaction with a call to the participate function using the same token but specifying only 1 wei as the amount. Since the participate function updates the `position.amount` an attacker can cause the legitimate transaction to fail the check if (`position.amount != 0 && token != position.token`) if they manage to execute their front-run transaction first.

**Recommendation**: 

Allow to participate using only the `msg.sender` address as a receiptient.



### Incorrect token transfer source in the stake function of `NonLockStakingPools` contract

**Severity**: High

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The stake function in the `NonLockStakingPools` contract is designed to allow users to stake tokens into a specific pool, identified by `poolId`. Due to an incorrect source address used in the token transfer operation within the `_depositToken` internal function, called by the stake function. The current implementation attempts to transfer tokens from `address(this)` to itself, rather than transferring tokens from the user (`msg.sender`) who is initiating the stake. 
```solidity
   poolInfo[poolId].totalStaked += amount;


   TokenTransfer._depositToken(pool.stakeToken, address(this), amount);
```
This misimplementation prevents the staking functionality from operating as intended, as the contract does not actually receive tokens from the users.


**Recommendation**: 

The `_depositToken` function's logic should be corrected to transfer tokens from the user (`msg.sender`) to the contract (`address(this)`), rather than attempting to transfer tokens from the contract to itself.

## Medium Risk

### Premature Finalization Vulnerability in `IDOPoolAbstract` Contract

**Severity** : Medium

**Status** : Resolved

**Description** :

The `IDOPoolAbstract` contract suffers from a significant flaw where it allows the contract owner to finalize an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) prematurely without any checks to ensure that predefined conditions, such as reaching an end date or achieving a minimum funding goal, have been met. This lack of validation opens the door to potential manipulation, where the contract owner could finalize the IDO at an opportune moment for personal gain, or prematurely end the IDO, denying participants the full duration to engage as intended.

**Recommendation** : 

Introduce additional conditions within the finalize function to ensure it can only be executed under appropriate circumstances, such as after the IDO has officially ended or once a minimum funding goal has been met. This can be achieved by implementing time-based conditions and/or participation thresholds.
```solidity
// Define IDO start and end times, and minimum funding goal
uint256 public idoStartTime;
uint256 public idoEndTime;
uint256 public minimumFundingGoal;

// Modifier to check that the current time is after the IDO end time
modifier onlyAfterIDOEnd() {
    require(block.timestamp > idoEndTime, "IDO has not ended yet");
    _;
}

// Modifier to check that the minimum funding goal has been met
modifier fundingGoalMet() {
    require(fundedUSDValue >= minimumFundingGoal, "Funding goal not met");
    _;
}

// Update the finalize function to include the new conditions
function finalize() external onlyOwner notFinalized onlyAfterIDOEnd fundingGoalMet {
    // Finalization logic
}
```

### Misplaced stake limit validation in stake function of `LockedStakingPools` contract

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The following check inside the stake function from `LockedStakingPools` contract attempts to restrict users from having more than 100 active stakes in any given pool. 

```solidity
   if (userStakeIds[poolId][msg.sender].length == 0) {
     if (userStakeIds[poolId][msg.sender].length > 100) revert TooManyStake();
     noUsersStaked[poolId] += 1;
   }
```
However, the check for `userStakeIds[poolId][msg.sender].length > 100` is incorrectly nested within another condition that checks if the user has no existing stakes (`length == 0`). This contradiction means that the check for exceeding the stake limit is only performed when the user has not yet staked anything (`length == 0`), which makes it impossible to trigger the `TooManyStake` revert under any circumstance.

**Recommendation**:

Before adding a new stake, check if the user already has 100 stakes.


### Incorrect Logic to Prevent Excessive Staking

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**: 

in LockedStakingPools.sol the logic intended to prevent a user from staking more than 100 times within a pool is flawed due to its placement inside a conditional block that only executes when the user has no previous stakes.

**Recommendation**: 

Move the check for the stake count limit (`userStakeIds[poolId][msg.sender].length > 100`) outside of the conditional block that checks if the user has not staked before (`userStakeIds[poolId][msg.sender].length == 0`), ensuring it is always evaluated.

## Low Risk

### Use of single step ownership transfer

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The `IDOPoolAbstract` contract in the protocol use the `OwnableUpgradeable` contract which allows changing the owner address. However, this contract does not implement a 2-step-process for transferring ownership. If the adminâ€™s address is set incorrectly, this could potentially result in critical functionalities becoming locked.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider implementing a two-step pattern. Utilize OpenZeppelin's Ownable2StepUpgradeable contract.



### Use of floating pragma

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged 

**Description**

All the contracts in the codebase are using the pragma solidity ^0.8.20. Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider locking the pragma version in the smart contracts.


### Misuse of Administrative Privileges

**Severity** : Low 

**Status**:  Acknowledged 

**Description**:

The contract assigns significant control to the pool administrator (`POOL_ADMIN_ROLE`), including the ability to add new pools, close existing pools, and set the yield APY for pools. While this role is necessary for managing the contract, it introduces a central point of control and trust. An attacker, or a malicious actor with access to the pool admin role, could exploit this control in several ways:

- Creation of Duplicate or Similar Pools: The admin could create multiple pools with identical or very similar terms to existing ones. This could confuse users, leading them to stake in less favorable or intended pools, potentially diluting the staking and yield generation in more legitimate pools.
- Prematurely Closing Pools: An admin could close pools at inopportune times, disrupting users' ability to earn yields and potentially benefiting from the timing of such closures.
- Manipulation of Yield APY: By adjusting the yield APY, an admin could make a pool appear more attractive than it actually is or reduce yields after users have staked a significant amount of tokens.
- 
**Recommendation**:
  
Decentralised Governance: Implement a decentralized governance mechanism for critical administrative actions.


### Missing Event Emissions for Critical Actions

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**:

YieldToken.sol  lacks event emissions for key actions such as `whitelisting/unwhitelisting` addresses and enabling/disabling the whitelist. Events are crucial for off-chain monitoring and transparency of contract operations, especially for actions that impact token transferability and minting operations.

**Recommendation**:

Define and emit events for all administrative actions, including address whitelisting, unwhitelisting, and changes to the whitelistEnabled flag. This aids in tracking changes and improves the contract's transparency.

### Upgradeable contracts missing method to disable initializers for implementation contracts

**Severity** : Low 

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description** : 

USDIDOPool.sol ETHIDOPool.sol IDOPoolAbstract.sol RoleControl.sol NonLockStakingPool.sol LockedStakingPools.sol are using `initialize()` method which uses `initializer` modifier. It is recommended in OpenZeppelinâ€™s documentation to not leave implementation contract uninitialised as attacker can take advantage of the same and that may affect the proxy contract. 

**Recommendation**: 

Use this suggested method in OpenZeppelinâ€™s documentation to mitigate this issue.

## Informational

### Mutable `RoleControl` Variable in YieldToken Contract

**Severity** : Informational

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description** :

The `roleControl` variable in `YieldToken` should be immutable for enhanced security but is currently not.

**Recommendation** : 

Declare roleControl as immutable




### Zero Address Check

**Severity** : Informational

**Status** : Resolved

**Description** :

Implement input validation in both `setTreasury` and `setIDOToken` functions to reject the zero address. This can be achieved using the require statement to ensure that the provided address is not the zero address,



### Missing Event Emission

**Severity** : Informational

**Status** : Resolved 

**Description** :

For each function, define an event that logs the relevant parameters changed by the function call. 
- `setTreasury`
- `setPoolYield`
- `setIDOToken`
- `setTokenPriceInUSD`
- `setEnableWhitelist`

### Lack of Input Validation for `setTokenPriceInUSD` Function

**Severity** : Informational

**Status** : Resolved

**Description** :

The `setTokenPriceInUSD` function in the `IDOPoolAbstract` contract lacks input validation, allowing for the setting of an IDO price to any value without restrictions. This poses a risk as it enables the contract owner to arbitrarily change the IDO price to potentially unfair or nonsensical values.

**Recommendation** : 

Implement input validation within the `setTokenPriceInUSD` function to ensure that the IDO price is within acceptable bounds. Use require statements to enforce these conditions and provide meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.

### Redundant Assignment of `idoSize` in finalize Function

**Severity** : Informational

**Status** : Resolved 

**Description** :

In the finalize function of the IDOPoolAbstract contract, the `idoSize` variable is assigned the balance of `idoToken` held by the contract twice in succession without any operation in between that would change the balance. This redundancy suggests a potential oversight in the contract's logic, where either the double assignment is unnecessary, or it indicates a missing piece of logic that should have been implemented between these two assignments.

**Recommendation** : 

Review the intended logic for the finalize function to determine if the double assignment of `idoSize` is necessary. If it is redundant, remove the first assignment to clean up the code and prevent potential confusion. If there was intended to be additional logic between these assignments that was omitted, implement the missing logic to ensure the function operates as expected.
