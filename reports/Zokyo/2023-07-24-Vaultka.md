# Findings

## High Risk

### _userInfo.liquidated is not set when liquidatePosition is a success

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

When the `liquidatePosition` is successful the _userInfo.liquidated is not set to true which will lead to repeated liquidations of the same position

**Recommendation**: 

set _userInfo.liquidated to true

### Inconsistency with the documentation

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The provided documentation states: `When a position is created, the Sake contract mints an equivalent amount of SAKE tokens for the user and stakes them in the MasterChef contract (IMasterChef.sol). This ensures that users receive proportional rewards for their staked SAKE tokens.` But the contract never stakes any tokens into the MasterChef. It only calls `unstakeAndLiquidate` in the liquidatePosition function, if the user has staked tokens to the MasterChef by themselves.

**Recommendation**: 

update the documentation or the code to be consistent
Comment from the client: Not an issue, by design. Users will need to stake tokens by themselves, they don’t have to if they don’t want to. unstakeAndLiquidate is there in case the user has some tokens staked.
if (MasterChef != address(0)) { this if statement checks if a user is staked or not and proceeds to unstack and burn in case a user was indeed staked (or had part of it in his wallet)


**Note #1**: Still inconsistent. Please update DOCs.

### Possible re-entrance

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract SakeVault there is a `velaStakingVault` with a function `withdrawVlp` which has a not introduced functionality. In this case, this function has callbacks, that could potentially lead to re-entrance issues in all functions when it used: closePosition and liquidatePosition.

**Recommendation**: 

make sure `withdrawVlp` does not call any external sources or protect `closePosition` and `liquidatePosition` from re-entrance attacks

### Function argument re-assigned

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract SakeVault at line #345 in the method `openPosition` the argument `user` is being re-assigned right at the beginning of the function making that argument not used at all.

**Recommendation**: 

remove the argument from the function or review the assignment

## Medium Risk

### Use safeIncreaseAllowance instead of safeApprove

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

While calling external contracts that consume your assets, try to avoid using `safeApprove` and use `safeIncreaseAllowance` instead. That will ensure you're not getting the 'SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance' revert in the case when the external contract doesn't consume the entire allowance.

**Recommendation**: 

replace `safeApprove` to `safeIncreaseAllowance` calls
 

### Liquidation works while paused

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**


The liquidatePosition function is functioning while the SakeVault is on pause

**Recommendation**: 

check and confirm if this is a correct behavior.

**Comment from the client**: 

By design, we don’t want bad debt at any time.

## Low Risk

### Using storage variables instead of memory ones

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Using storage variable for multiple reading access (ex: in `closePosition` function) costs lots of gas. Consider using memory variables when multiple readings occur. Do not forget that copying excess fields from the storage to memory would also cost additional gas that you can save.

**Recommendation**: 

changing the variable from storage to memory and replacing assignments directly to the storage variable will save you gas (only `closePosition` could save about 19k of gas).

**Comment from the client:** _userInfo is indeed reading but also writing hence the need for storage

**Note #1**: 

While still writing, there is a way to save tons of gas by only reading what you need once and writing only what was changed. As we mentioned earlier, a small fix in the closePosition function could save about 19k of gas

### Inconsistency in function declarations

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Right now there are 4 functions that accept both arguments user address and the id of position: `getUpdatedDebtAndValue`, `getCurrentPosition`, `closePosition`, and `liquidatePosition`. all of them but `liquidatePosition` accept position then user, while the `liquidatePosition` accepts user, then position.

**Recommendation**: 

change the order of the arguments in the `liquidatePosition` function

### Modifier never used

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract Water2 there is a modifier `onlyAdmin` and the state variable `admin` which is never used in the code.

**Recommendation**: 

remove the modifier and state variable declarations.

### Tautology or contradiction

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract, SakeVault in the method `updateFeeStrategyParams` there is a check for `_feeStrategy.maxFeeSplitSlope1` to be greater or equal to zero. However, the declared type of this element is `uint128` which certainly could not go down to zero

**Recommendation**: 

review if that statement is what you really wanted to check for and if so, remove it because it is not needed there

## Informational

### Uncommented code

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

The code looks to be very complex, but it lacks comments.

**Recommendation**: 

add comments to the code, as well as NatSpecs for each function

### Complex functions, repeating functionality

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged


The current function implementation is too complex and also often repeat the functionality already presented in other function.

**Recommendation**: 

split the functionality into multiple functions, re-use functions with the same functionality.
