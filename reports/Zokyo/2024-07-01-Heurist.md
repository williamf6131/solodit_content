# Findings

## High Risk

### Unrestricted repeated minting via Partner NFT Transfer Exploit

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `partnerFreeMint` function is vulnerable to an exploit where users can repeatedly transfer the partner NFT to different wallets, allowing unlimited minting without adhering to the time restrictions. This occurs because the contract does not verify the ID of the partner NFT, making it possible for users to undermine the intended limitations.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a mechanism to track the usage of each specific partner NFT ID for the `partnerFreeMint` function. This can be achieved by maintaining a mapping of NFT IDs to their last minting timestamp or a boolean indicating whether they have been used for minting. Additionally, ensure that users cannot reuse the same NFT for minting until the time restriction has elapsed.

### Reentrance in `partnerFreeMint` 

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `partnerFreeMint` function doesn’t implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern. The `_safeMint` function call occurs before updating the `lastMinted` mapping. If the to address is a contract, it could call back into the `partnerFreeMint` function, allowing re-entrance before `lastMinted` is updated and bypassing the 24 hours limit.

**Recommendation**: 

To prevent reentrancy attacks, update the `lastMinted` mapping before calling the `_safeMint` function.

**Fix**: Client addressed the issue in commit a27af000 by adhering to the checks-effects-interactions pattern. It is recommended though to add an extra layer of security by applying the reentrancy guard modifier to the function since the code base utilizes it already in other places of the codebase. 

**Update**: The client added the reentrancy guard modifier.

### Insufficient Validation of Referral Address in mint 

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The `mint` function allows users to specify a referral address to receive a discount on the minting fee. However, the referral address is not validated. This means that users can set the referral address to any arbitrary address, including an address that they control, to exploit the discount mechanism and potentially drain referral rewards.

**Recommendation**: 

To prevent abuse of the referral system, implement validation checks to ensure that the referral address is a legitimate and authorized referrer.

 ### Holder of Partner NFT can mint unlimited NFTs in `partnerFreeMint`

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The `partnerFreeMint` function allows users to mint a new token if they hold at least one token of a whitelisted partner NFT. However, this can be exploited by an attacker who holds a single partner NFT, allowing them to mint an unlimited number of `ZkImagine` NFTs over time. This undermines the intended scarcity and value of the NFTs.

**Recommendation**: 

Limit the number of free mints a single partner NFT holder can perform.

**Auditor’s Comment**:

In the snippet below:
```solidity
        _updateGlobalTimeThreshold();
        nextMint[partnerNFTAddress][partnerNFTtokenId] = globalTimeThreshold;
```
The new value of `globalTimeThreshold` becomes ~ `block.timestamp`. 
Theoretically, The attacker can mint on every block throughout the day.
The issue also exists in `signatureFreeMint` as the client decided to make the signature replayable :
```solidity
        _updateGlobalTimeThreshold();
        nextSignatureMint[signature] = globalTimeThreshold;
```
But This basically makes it replayable without a limit.

## Medium Risk

### Missing gap to Avoid Storage Collisions

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `ZkImagine` contract is intended to be an upgradeable smart contract, but do not have a `__gap` variable.
In upgradeable contracts, it's crucial to include a `_gap` to ensure that any additional storage variables added in future contract upgrades do not collide with existing storage variables. This is especially important when inheriting from multiple upgradeable contracts.

**Recommendation**: 

Include a `_gap` as the last storage variable to `ZkImagine` contract to reserve space for future storage variables and prevent storage collisions. This is a common practice to ensure compatibility and avoid issues when upgrading the contract in the future.

## Low Risk

### Use of `ecrecover` Instead of Native Account Abstraction in `_recoverSigner` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `_recoverSigner` function uses the `ecrecover` method for signature recovery. When deploying on `zkSync`, it is recommended to use native account abstraction instead of `ecrecover` for signature validation, see here https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/best-practices#use-native-account-abstraction-over-ecrecover-for-validation .

**Recommendation**: 

Modify the signature recovery mechanism to use zkSync's native account abstraction methods for better security and compatibility.

### Lack of Two-Step Ownership Transfer 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The `ZkImagine` contract does not implement a two-step process for transferring ownership. In its current state, ownership can be transferred in a single step, which can be risky as it could lead to accidental or malicious transfers of ownership without proper verification.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a two-step process for ownership transfer where the new owner must explicitly accept the ownership. It is advisable to use OpenZeppelin’s Ownable2Step.

### Owner can renounce ownership

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Ownable contracts includes a function named `renounceOwnership()` which can be used to remove the ownership of the contract. 

If this function is called on the `ZkImagine` contract, it will result in the contract becoming disowned. This would subsequently break functions of the `ZkImagine` contract that rely on onlyOwner modifier.



**Recommendation**: 

override the function to disable its functionality, ensuring the contract cannot be disowned e.g.
```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public override onlyOwner { 
revert ("renounceOwnership is disabled"); 
}
```


### Missing Event Emission in `setBaseURI`

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `setBaseURI` function allows the contract owner to update the base URI for the NFTs. However, the function does not emit an event when the base URI is changed. Emitting an event for such actions is a best practice as it provides transparency and helps in tracking changes on the blockchain.

**Recommendation**: 

Add an event emission to the `setBaseURI` function to log when the base URI is updated.

### Centralization Risk

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The `ZkImagine` contract grants significant control to the contract owners through several functions. This centralization poses a substantial risk, as it places considerable trust and control in a single entity. If the owner's private key is compromised, it could lead to catastrophic disruptions or malicious misuse of the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a multi-signature wallet for executing Owner functions. This requires multiple authorized signatures to approve critical actions, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.


### Gas Intensive While Loop in `_updateGlobalTimeThreshold` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `_updateGlobalTimeThreshold` function utilizes a while loop that performs storage writes, which are among the most expensive operations in the EVM. If the loop iterates many times, it can quickly exceed the gas limit, causing the transaction to fail and undermining the contract's functionality. This while loop can be optimized by using a simple mathematical formula to achieve the same result, significantly reducing gas costs.

**Recommendation**: 

Replace the while loop in `_updateGlobalTimeThreshold` with a simple mathematical formula to avoid excessive gas costs and potential transaction failures. The `globalTimeThreshold` can be updated in one step by calculating the smallest multiple of `freeMintCooldownWindow` that is greater than the current block timestamp.

## Informational

### Immutable Mint Fee and Referral Discount Percentage

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `mintFee` and `referralDiscountPct` are defined as constant values, making them immutable. This inflexibility can be problematic if the project needs to adjust the minting fee or referral discount percentage in the future due to changes in market conditions or other considerations.

**Recommendation**: 

Replace the constant keyword with state variables and provide functions to allow the owner to update these values. Ensure that these functions are protected by appropriate access control (e.g., `onlyOwner`) to prevent unauthorized changes. 

### Signature Replay Vulnerability Across Different Domains in Function `signatureFreeMint`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The current implementation of the `signatureFreeMint` function does not include domain-specific parameters in the signature, such as the contract address and chain ID. This omission allows for the same signature to be replayed across different domains, leading to potential exploitation where an attacker can mint tokens on different domains using the same signature.

**Recommendation**: 

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to incorporate domain-specific parameters into the signature. Include the contract address and chain ID as part of the data being signed. This ensures that each signature is unique to a specific domain, preventing replay attacks across different domains.

### Token ID potential duplication due to manipulable total supply

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The current implementation generates Token IDs based on the total supply of tokens. This approach is problematic, especially for burnable ERC721 tokens where the total supply can be decreased, potentially leading to the creation of duplicate Token IDs. When tokens are burned, the total supply reduces, causing subsequent mints to potentially reuse previously assigned Token IDs, thereby violating the uniqueness property of Token IDs.

**Recommendation**: 

To ensure the uniqueness of Token IDs and prevent duplication, it is recommended to use a separate, dedicated counter for Token ID generation. This counter should increment with each mint and should not be influenced by current total supply of tokens or changes to the total supply. By decoupling Token ID generation from the total supply, you can maintain the integrity and uniqueness of Token IDs.


### Missing Boundaries Check in Setter Functions

**Severity:** Informational

**Status:** Acknowledged

**Description**

The setter functions `setMintFee`, `setReferralDiscountPct`, and `setFreeMintCooldownWindow` in the `ZkImagine` contract are used to update various important parameters. While they perform some basic checks, they are missing additional boundary checks to ensure the parameters are within sensible ranges. This can potentially lead to issues if invalid values are set, affecting the contract's functionality or causing unintended behavior.

**Recommendation**: 

Add boundary checks in the setter functions to ensure that the parameters are within appropriate ranges and prevent invalid values from being set. E.g.

```solidity
function setMintFee(uint256 fee) external onlyOwner { 
require(fee > 0, "Fee must be greater than 0"); 
require(fee <= 1 ether, "Fee exceeds maximum allowed"); // Example upper limit mintFee = fee; emit MintFeeChanged(fee); }
```



### Missing Sanity Checks in initialize Function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The initialize function in the `ZkImagine` contract sets initial values for various parameters, including the mint fee, referral discount, cooldown window, and start timestamp. However, it lacks sanity checks to ensure that these parameters are valid and within reasonable ranges. Without these checks, the contract may be initialized with incorrect or invalid values, E.g. the mint fee could be initialized to zero.

**Recommendation**: 

Add sanity checks to the initialize function to validate the parameters and ensure they are within acceptable ranges. This will help prevent initialization with unintended or invalid values and ensure the contract operates as expected.

### Unused Import of Ownable

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

The contract imports Ownable from OpenZeppelin's contracts but does not use it in the code. Instead, it uses `OwnableUpgradeable`, which is designed for upgradeable contracts and provides similar functionality. This makes the import of Ownable redundant and unnecessary.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the unused import of Ownable to clean up the code and avoid unnecessary dependencies. This will make the contract more readable and reduce potential confusion regarding which ownership management implementation is being utilized.

### Missing `nonReentrant` Modifier

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `ZkImagine` smart contract implements the Check-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern, which is a recognized best practice to prevent reentrancy attacks. This pattern ensures that state changes are made before external calls, thereby mitigating reentrancy risks. However, certain functions such as `partnerFreeMint`, `signatureFreeMint` and `claimReferralFee`  do not include the `nonReentrant` modifier, which serves as an additional safeguard against reentrancy attacks. While the current implementation uses CEI, adding the `nonReentrant` modifier would provide an extra layer of security.

**Recommendation**:

Add the `nonReentrant` modifier to functions that involve external interactions after state changes, even if the CEI pattern is correctly implemented. This practice enhances the contract's security by preventing any possibility of reentrancy, thus offering additional assurance against potential vulnerabilities.
