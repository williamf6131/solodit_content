# Findings

## High Risk

### Minter can burn tokens of other accounts

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The minter can burn tokens from any address, even from addresses whose private key it does not have.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to not allow the minter to burn the tokens directly from other accounts. Review the business and operational logic for the same. Refer this Openzeppelin Burnable ERC20 contract, which allows only the tokens of the msg.sender to be burnt.

### Reentrancy in transfer(), mint(), burn(), addNonStakingAccount() and removeNonStakingAccount functions

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The functions _transfer(), _mint(), _burn(), addNonStakingAccount() and removeNonStakingAccount() are susceptible to reentrancy because an external call to YieldTracker contract(out of scope of this audit) is made via the updateRewards() function. 

Although addNonStakingAccount() and removeNonStakingAccount() is an onlyAdmin function, and mint() and burn() is an onlyMinter function, it is expected that the function follows a checks-effects-interaction pattern to avoid any kind of reentrancy as a security best practice.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to move the _updateRewards() function call on line: 192 and 193 in _transfer to the end of the function instead. Also, it is advised to move the _updateRewards() function call on line: 157 to the end of the _mint() function instead in order to mitigate this issue. Similarly, it is advised to move the _updateRewards() function call on line: 172 to the end of the _burn() function instead, in order to mitigate this issue. The same is advised for the addNonStakingAccount() and removeNonStakingAccount() functions. This will ensure checks-effects interactions pattern to be followed. 


### Token name and symbol can be changed

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The setInfo() function can be used to change the name and symbol of the token even after the token has been deployed. This is not advisable because the gov can change the name and symbol of the token anytime.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a requirement check to prevent calling the setInfo() function more than once.

### Possibility of manipulation of rewards

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**


There is a possibility that the transferring of tokens to yourself can lead to increases in rewards due to the call to _updateRewards() function. The existence and impact of this issue is unknown, as the YieldTracker contract is out of scope of this audit.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to review the business and operational logic for the same.

## Medium Risk

### Missing zero address check in setYieldTrackers()

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**


The yieldTrackers array can have zero address being set in its array of addresses via the setYieldTrackers function. This could lead to revert on function calls to recoverClaim() and claim() functions.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add the missing zero address checks for yieldTrackers. It is also advised to review business and operational logic.

### yieldTrackers can be changed anytime

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

It should also be noted that the yieldTrackers addresses can be changed by the gov which could lead to undiscovered or unknown bugs such as Denial of Service(which depends on the YieldTracker contracts that are out of scope of this audit). 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to provide necessary checks to prevent this from happening and make the process of changing of yieldTrackers addresses more decentralized.

### Missing zero address check in setGov()

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

There is missing zero address check for _gov in setGov() function. This could lead to gov being accidentally set to zero address and its access to gov thus being lost forever. This is because only gov can change the address of gov, but once the gov is set as a zero address, the gov address can never be changed. This would result in all the onlyGov becoming uncallable.

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to add missing zero address check for the gov address.

### For loop over dynamic array 

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The functions _updateRewards(), recoverClaim() and claim() function have a for loop over a dynamic array. This can lead to out of gas issues if the array becomes too large.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add a check on the max length that the array can take.

### ERC20 approve race condition

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The ERC20 contract has a race condition in its approve function, which can be exploited by attackers via a frontrun. For example, letâ€™s say Alice approves Bob for 10 tokens in transaction 1, but then changes the approve to 5 tokens in transaction 2. Bob can exploit this by spending the 10 tokens in a transaction 3 and executing it before transaction 2 by paying a higher gas fee.

**Recommendation**: 

This can be mitigated by using the increaseAllowance() and decreaseAllowance() functions along with the approve function, such as in the Openzeppelin version of ERC20 tokens. Refer to this and this for more information on its implementation.

## Informational

### Missing events for critical functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Missing events for critical events: setInPrivateTransferMode(), setHandler(), addAdmin(), removeAdmin(), addNonStakingAccount() and removeNonStakingAccount()


**Recommendation**: 

Add and emit event for the above mentioned functions carrying out critical operations. This would be a best practice for offchain monitoring.
