# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Unrestricted “On-Behalf” Borrowing

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Evoq.sol → borrow() / internal call _borrow()
PositionsManager.sol → borrowLogic()
These functions allow specifying arbitrary _borrower and _receiver addresses without verifying that msg.sender is actually authorized to borrow on behalf of _borrower. As a result, an attacker can borrow against another user’s collateral, sending the borrowed tokens to themselves.

**Scenario:**

The attacker sees that User A (victim) has a large collateral.
Attacker calls borrow(...) with _borrower = User A and _receiver = Attacker.
Protocol sees User A’s collateral, deems the borrow safe, and transfers tokens to the attacker.
User A is left with the borrowed debt and no tokens.

**PoC: **

```solidity
function testBorrow2Attack() public {
       uint256 amount = 10_000 ether;


       address bob = address(0x1234);
       address alice = address(0xdeff);
       console.log("Bob address:", bob);
       console.log("Alice address:", alice);
       deal(usdc, address(alice), INITIAL_BALANCE * WAD);
       uint256 aliceBalance = ERC20(usdc).balanceOf(address(alice));
       console.log(aliceBalance);
       vm.startPrank(alice);
       ERC20(usdc).approve(address(evoq), 2 * amount);
       evoq.supply(vUsdc, 2 * amount);


       vm.startPrank(bob);


       evoq.borrow(vUsdt, amount, alice, bob);
   }
```
In other words, Alice can supply funds to the protocol, and Bob can borrow funds on behalf of her(bob need not put any collateral into the protocol!). This will also mean that Alice's debt position increases instead of Bob.

**Recommendation**:

Require msg.sender == _borrower or implement a robust delegation (e.g., signed approval) for on-behalf borrowing.
Disallow free-form _borrower unless proper authorization is enforced.

### Unrestricted “On-Behalf” Withdrawal

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description (Contracts & Functions)**:

Evoq.sol → withdraw() / internal call _withdraw()
PositionsManager.sol → withdrawLogic()
These functions let the caller specify _supplier and _receiver with no checks confirming that msg.sender is _supplier or has _supplier’s consent. This can allow an attacker to withdraw another user’s supplied collateral to themselves.

**Scenario:**

Attacker calls withdraw(...) with _supplier = Victim and _receiver = Attacker.
The protocol sees Victim’s collateral, processes withdrawal, and sends tokens to the attacker.
Victim’s collateral is stolen with no action on Victim’s part.

**PoC: **
```solidity
   function testWithdraw1_Attack() public {
      uint256 amount = 10000 ether;
      uint256 collateral = amount;


       address bob = address(0x1234);
       address alice = address(0xdeff);
       console.log("Bob address:", bob);
       console.log("Alice address:", alice);
       deal(usdc, address(alice), INITIAL_BALANCE * WAD);
       uint256 aliceBalance = ERC20(usdc).balanceOf(address(alice));
       console.log(aliceBalance);
       vm.startPrank(alice);
       ERC20(usdc).approve(address(evoq), collateral);
       evoq.supply(vUsdc, collateral);




       uint256 bobBalance = ERC20(usdc).balanceOf(address(bob));
       console.log("Bob balance before Unauthorized Withdraw: ", bobBalance);


       vm.startPrank(bob);
       evoq.withdraw(vUsdc, collateral, alice, bob);


       bobBalance = ERC20(usdc).balanceOf(address(bob));
       console.log("Bob balance after Unauthorized Withdraw", bobBalance);


   }
```
In other words, if Alice supplies funds to the smart contract as a supplier, an unauthorized user Bob can withdraw her funds or collateral from the smart contract.

**Recommendation**:

Enforce msg.sender == _supplier or require an explicit authorization mechanism for on-behalf withdrawals.
Alternatively, provide distinct “withdraw self” vs. “withdraw on behalf” methods with strong permission checks.

### Missing Address Validation in Setters

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description (Contracts & Functions)**:

EvoqGovernance.sol (e.g., setPositionsManager(), setTreasuryVault(), etc.)
Certain governance or admin functions allow setting critical addresses (like positionsManager, treasuryVault) to the zero address. This breaks protocol logic if a call to address(0) silently no-ops or otherwise fails unexpectedly, yet returns success.

**Scenario:**

An owner or multisig calls setPositionsManager(address(0)) by mistake.
The system’s subsequent calls to positionsManager become calls to address(0), effectively doing nothing or reverting unpredictably.
Operations dependent on positionsManager fail until corrected.

**Recommendation:**

Add require(_newAddress != address(0), "Zero address not allowed") in all setters for critical addresses.
Implement a timelock or thorough review step before finalizing critical parameter changes.


### Deprecated Markets May Prevent Liquidations When isLiquidateBorrowPaused Is True

**Severity**: Medium 

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Context:**

**Contracts Involved:**

EvoqGovernance.sol
setIsDeprecated(address _poolToken, bool _isDeprecated)
EvoqGovernance.sol
setIsLiquidateBorrowPaused(address _poolToken, bool _isPaused)

**Description:** 

Currently, in the EvoqGovernance contract, when deprecating a market using the setIsDeprecated function, the contract ensures that borrowing is paused by checking isBorrowPaused before applying the deprecation flag. However, there is no corresponding check or logic to handle the isLiquidateBorrowPaused flag when a market is deprecated. This omission can lead to scenarios where a market is deprecated, but the isLiquidateBorrowPaused flag remains true, thereby preventing liquidators from liquidating borrowers in that deprecated market.

**Scenario:**

**Deprecating a Market:**

The contract owner calls setIsDeprecated(_poolToken, true) to deprecate a specific market.
The function checks that isBorrowPaused is true before allowing the deprecation.
The market is marked as deprecated by setting marketPauseStatus[_poolToken].isDeprecated = true.

**Impact on Liquidations:**

If isLiquidateBorrowPaused is already true for the deprecated market, liquidators are unable to liquidate borrowers in that market.
This situation undermines the protocol's risk management by allowing borrowers to maintain positions in a deprecated market without the ability to be liquidated, potentially leading to increased systemic risk.

**Recommendation:**

Modify the setIsDeprecated function to ensure that isLiquidateBorrowPaused is set to false when deprecating a market. This ensures that liquidations remain possible even after deprecation.

**Client comment:** 

This logic is intentional. Markets can be deprecated regardless of isLiquidateBorrowPaused is True or False. This gives operator more flexibility to pause/unpause liquidation borrow. For this reason, we prefer to leave things as it is.

### ERC20 with Transfer Fees Not Handled in PositionsManager

**Severity**: Medium 

**Status**: Acknowledged 


**Description:**

The current implementation of PositionsManager does not account for ERC20 tokens with transfer fees. These tokens deduct a percentage of the transferred amount as a fee, causing the actual amount received by the contract to be less than the amount specified in the transfer call. As a result, functions like supplyLogic, borrowLogic, repayLogic, and withdrawLogic assume the full amount has been transferred or received, potentially leading to incorrect accounting and vulnerabilities.

**For example:**

In supplyLogic, the contract updates the user's supply balance with the full amount specified by the user, but the actual transferred amount could be less due to fees.
Similarly, in repayLogic, the amount credited towards repayment might be incorrect, leaving some debt unpaid.
This discrepancy can lead to mismatched balances, calculation errors, and a false sense of security in the protocol's state.

**Recommendation:**

the contract should dynamically calculate the actual amount received during token transfers. This can be done by comparing the contract's token balance before and after the transfer operation

**Client comment:** 

The assets listed on Evoq will be required to not have transfer fees. Given the small likelihood for assets to turn on fees, we decided not to implement the recommendations.


### Cached Borrow Index in Liquidation Logic Leads to Discrepancy with Underlying Pool

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**:

The _isLiquidatable function in EvoqUtils uses cached borrow indexes (lastPoolIndexes[_poolToken].lastBorrowPoolIndex) to calculate user debt. These indexes are updated only during interactions with the market but may become outdated over time. As a result:
Users who are liquidatable on the underlying pool may not be flagged as liquidatable in Evoq.
Liquidators must first interact with the market (e.g., supply, borrow, or repay) to update the cached indexes before executing liquidations, adding friction to the process.
This discrepancy introduces inconsistency with the liquidation mechanics of the underlying pool (e.g. Venus) and reduces the efficacy of liquidators.

**Recommendation**:

Ensure that _isLiquidatable explicitly calls _updateP2PIndexes for all user-entered markets to align with real-time data.
implement an off-chain or on-chain mechanism to periodically update lastPoolIndexes for all markets to minimize reliance on liquidator-triggered updates.

**Client comment**: 

Under normal use case, this does not pose any issue. _isLiquidatable function is always called after updateP2PIndexes in the contract logic.


## Low Risk

### Redundant checks in EvoqUtils.sol

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

In EvoqUtils.sol, there are redundant checks as follows: 
Redundant check on line: 211 in _supplyAllowed()-         
      require(marketStatus[_poolToken].isCreated, "market not created");

The same redundant code exists on line: 240 in _borrowAllowed()
       require(marketStatus[_poolToken].isCreated, "market not created");

These checks are not required and are redundant as these checks are already done on line: 252 of supplyLogic() and on line: 342 in borrowLogic() in PositionsManager.sol .

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to remove the redundant checks and code as mentioned above.

### Ownership can be lost if transferred to an incorrect address

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**:

The EvoqStorage.sol and Treasury contract does not implement a two-step process for transferring ownership. In its current state, ownership can be transferred in a single step, which can be risky as it could lead to accidental or malicious transfers of ownership without proper verification.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to use Openzeppelin’s Ownable2StepUpgradeable contract instead of OwnableUpgradeable to mitigate this issue.

**Comment**:

The client said that under normal use case, this does not pose any issue and that this would be refactored at some point.

## Informational

### Funds will be stuck if the receiver is the contract itself

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**:

In PositionsManager.sol, if the receiver in borrowLogic() or withdrawLogic() is set as address(this), then it can lead to funds being stuck forever. It may also lead to undiscovered accounting errors in the smart contract.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised add checks to disallow setting the receiver as address(this).

**Comment**: 

The client says that in normal case this won’t pose any issue.

### Missing Validation for Zero toRepay in repayLogic

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**:

The repayLogic function calculates the toRepay value as the minimum of _getUserBorrowBalanceInOf(_poolToken, _onBehalf) and _amount. However, the function does not check whether toRepay is zero after this calculation. If toRepay is zero, the function continues to execute and incurs unnecessary gas costs without performing any meaningful repayment.
This issue arises when:
The user's debt for the specified _poolToken is already fully repaid (_getUserBorrowBalanceInOf(_poolToken, _onBehalf) == 0).
The _amount provided by the caller is greater than zero.
In such cases, the contract performs operations that ultimately have no effect, leading to wasted gas.

**Recommendation:**

Introduce a validation check after calculating toRepay to ensure it is greater than zero before proceeding. If toRepay is zero, revert the transaction to prevent unnecessary execution
