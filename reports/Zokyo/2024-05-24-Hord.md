# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Missing validator’s registering

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

HordStakingManager.sol, launchNewValidatorWithSSV()
The `removeValidatorFromSSV()` function contains the check on validator to be initialized:
`require(isValidatorInitialized[pubkey], "VNI")`. However, this pubkeys mapping is not set
during the SSV validator registration. Therefore, it is not possible to remove a validator,
unless it was already registered as a regular validator (via the launchNewValidator())

**Recommendation:**

Based on the launchNewValidator() function, consider adding another pubkeys mapping
isSSVValidatorInitialized SSV related functions. Note, that it is important to make this
pubkeys mapping different from the existing one, to avoid intersecting of SSV and regular
validators. OR verify that validators’ lists will not intersect, and thus a single mapping can be
used - in that case add validators to the mapping in launchNewValidatorWithSSV().

**Post audit.**

Validators are now tracked within the same registry (isValidatorInitialized). The Hord team
verified that there will be no intersection between SSV validators and regular validators.

### Missing access modifier

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

StakingConfigurator.sol, setTolerancePercentageForRewards()

The `setTolerancePercentageForRewards()` function can be called by anyone, so tolerance
percentage for rewards can be changed without HordCongress proposal mechanism.
The issue is marked as Medium, as despite the missing authorization check, the setting itself
has low impact on the funds processing.

**Recommendation:**

Add `onlyHordCongress` access modifier.

## Low Risk

### Missing parameter’s boundaries validation

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

StakingConfiguration.ol, etTimeBetweenSetStatCall()
New parameter (timeBetweenSetStatCall) wa introduced, though no validation were
performed. It i recommended to have everal validation for each parameter:
- secure default value
- min and max boundaries
- extreme value (in cae if boundarie are not introduced)
- 
Though, no default value is set (including deployment/tuning/upgrade script) and there is
no min/max value to validate againt. Therefore the parameter is expoed to the risk of
misconfiguration and/or human error.

The issue is marked a Low, a depite the risk of misconfiguration, the parameter can be
changed at any time by the congress. However, the change of the incorrectly set parameter
may take some time (baed on the congress procedure), thu creating a window of
instability.

**Recommendation:**

Provide the default value for the parameter, introduce reaonable min/max boundarie for
the parameter.
**Post audit.**
Parameter i validated againt the max value of 10 day

### Function never called

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

HordETHStakingManager.sol, _launchNAwValidator()
Function is never called, and it seems to be an internal clone of the launchValidator()
function.

**Recommendation:**

Delete the unused function or finalize thA functionality.

### Missing consistency checks for the ETH movements recorded

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

HordETHStakingManager.sol, setValidatorStats()

After the upgrade, the contract utilizes new funds tracking mechanism:
- totalETHOnContractRecorded to track the balance after the last stats update
- amountETHDepositedInMeantime and amountETHUsedToPayDebtInMeantime to track in/out movements

However, there is no validation for the consistency after the upgrade. Consider case when values are not validated after the upgrade and the next scenario:
- after the upgrade, either ETH move or debt payment (for the withdrawal manager) can be performed (as it is a running contract)
- In that case, the setValidatorStats() will fail, as the recorded balance is 0, though debt is already set.
The issue will be resolved either after the appropriate number of deposits or with another contract upgrade.

The issue is marked as Low, as although the contract can be blocked from the stats update before the appropriate amount of deposits, all responsible functions are controlled by the maintainer. Nevertheless, because of the potential impact, the issue is still listed in the report.

**Recommendation**. 

Add validations to restrict debt increasing operations before the syncing of the total ETH stored OR verify that the setValidatorStats() will be called immediately after the upgrade before other maintenance operations.

**Post-audit:** 

The Hord team confirmed that the protocol will be paused during the upgrade and that the team will set the initial values via the setValidatorStats() call. Though the security team still leaves a concern regarding the risks of the manual operation processing, as there are no changes in the deploy/upgrade script.

## Informational

###  Event parameter changed the meaning 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

HordETHStakingWithdrawalManager.sol, requestWithdraw()
NewUserWithdrawalRequest event emission

Before the change, the event represented the current value of reserves (totalETHReservesForPayingDebt()) as for the end of the operations. After the change the event represents the value before the operation - as the value of unAllocatedBuffer (used in the totalETHReservesForPayingDebt() is changed during the function execution and so the event emits the cached value from the beginning of the function.

The issue is marked as Info, as the change does not affect the onchain logic, however can affect the further offchain processing of the event data, thus the feedback from the team is required regarding what value should be emitted (for the start of the operation, or for the end).

**Recommendation.**

Verify the change of the emitted data and its impact on the offchain processing.

**Post-audit:**
Desired behavior - parameter nwo represents the initial state of reserves for the further backend processing

### Wrapped stETH is never used 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

HordETHStakingManager.sol, wrapStETH()

wstETH received after wrapping of stETH is never used or approved, and so - effectively locked on the contract.

The issue is marked as Info, as it refers to the business logic decision and requires the feedback from the Hord team before classification. 

**Recommendation.**

Verify the usage of the wstETH and that it is supposed to be processed via the swapLSDToExactAmountOfETH(). Consider adding validation that the wStETH will stay as one of the supported LSD tokens 
**Post-audit:** The Hord team confirmed, that the wstEth should be locked on the contract until the maintainter will decide to process the swap to Eth (to launch the new validator or to pay the debt to the users)

### Precision value has double meaning 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

HordETHStakingManager.sol, getLSDTokenBalanceInETH()
HordETHStakingManager.sol, depositWithLSDToken()

Looks like stakingConfiguration.percentPrecision() has double meaning in terms of application. It is used as an intermediate accuracy multiplier for the price calculation and as an price lining up to token decimals (as for the accuracy correction after the chainlink price extraction). Though, in a general case, the intermediate accuracy for HETH/ETH price calculation does not equal the accuracy for the oracle price lining up for stETH.

**Recommendation**. 

Verify that indeed the same value is required for both cases (1e18) and consider using a separate value for chainlink price lining up.
**Post-audit:** The Hord team verified the value to be the same for both cases.
