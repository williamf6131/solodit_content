# Findings

## Medium Risk

### The contract will be paused after liquidation

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Contract**: LPMigration

**Function**: liquidate

**Details**: 

one line #103 there is a call to the `IPausableERC20.pause()` function. It is an unconditioned call so even if the contract was not initially paused, it will be paused after `liquidate()` is called.

**Recommendations**: 

add a local variable and assign it to the value of `IPausableERC20.paused` before line #86. Then use this value for a condition for both unpause/pause function calls		

### The contract will be paused after `withdrawAllGTH`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Contract**: LPMigration

**Function**: withdrawAllGTH

**Details**: 

one line #150 there is a call to the `IPausableERC20.pause()` function. It is an unconditioned call so even if the contract was not initially paused, it will be paused after `withdrawAllGTH()` is called.

**Recommendations**: 

add a local variable and assign it to the value of `IPausableERC20.paused` before line #140. Then use this value for a condition for both unpause/pause function calls
