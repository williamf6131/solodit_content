## High Risk

### CryptoPunks can be stolen via mint frontrunning

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

Since the CryptoPunks NFT collection not implementing the ERC721 standard, depositing of CryptoPunks NFTs is handled via a separate flow:
Token owner needs to call `offerPunkForSaleToAddress` and set the `toAddress` value to the address of the pool the token will be deposited into.
Token owner then calls the mint function of the PNFTToken contract.
The PNFTToken contract buys CryptoPunk from its owner. 

However, the mint function can be called by anyone, so the attacker can frontrun the legitimate mint call. The contract will buy the NFT and it will be on the caller's account even if the caller is not the owner of the token.
```js
 it("CryptoPunk can be stolen via mint frontrunning", async () => {
   // user 1 want to supply CryptoPunk NFT
   await app.cryptopunks
     .connect(app.user1)
     .offerPunkForSaleToAddress(tokenId, 0, app.pcryptopunks.address);


   //user 2 frontrun the mint call
   await app.pcryptopunks.connect(app.user2).mint(tokenId);
   await app.unitroller
     .connect(app.user2)
     .enterNFTMarkets([app.pcryptopunks.address]);


   expect(await app.pcryptopunks.ownerOf(tokenId)).to.equal(app.user2.address);
 });
```

**Recommendation**: 

It is advisable to verify that `msg.sender` is the rightful owner of the token, before buying a CryptoPunk. 

### Borrowers can get Interest-free loans

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract PTokens.sol, the borrowing balance of a borrower is calculated as follows:
```solidity
/* Calculate new borrow balance using the interest index:
* recentBorrowBalance = borrower.borrowBalance * market.borrowIndex / borrower.borrowIndex
*/
```
The above formula in Solidity is as following, 
```solidity
uint principalTimesIndex = mul_(borrowSnapshot.principal, borrowIndex);
return div_(principalTimesIndex, borrowSnapshot.interestIndex);
```

Here, when the principal and ratio of borrow indices are both small the result can equal the principal, due to automatic truncation of division within solidity.

If that is the case, then the loan will accrue no actual interest but still be counted as a loan. 

This allows users to borrow small loans for short-term periods with no actual interest which they can deposit back to Paribus to earn interest on that.

Since the client is planning to deploy the contracts on chains where transaction cost is cheap such as Polygon, zkSync, or any other L2 layer chain, the chances of this attack are enhanced as the attacker will not need to care for the small gas fees.

Recommendation: Update the method to calculate the borrow balance being rounded up instead of being truncated. 

## Medium Risk

### Improper slippage tolerance can leads to unexpected results

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The `FlashloanLiquidator.executeOperation` function is called when a flash loan is made and can only be triggered by an Aave pool after receiving flashloan. The purpose of this function is to perform the liquidation of a specified debt position, which was previously calculated by getting a price from a Chainlink feed. 
If the user chooses to get underlying tokens as reward, the function swaps the amount intended to repay the debt, allowing for providing the entire seized amount as an input amount during the swap. This can result in no reward for a liquidator if the price is manipulated. 
Alternatively, If the user wants  to get an choosen asset as a reward, the function swaps all the flash loaned assets, setting the amountOutMin parameter as totalDebt + 1. However, due to potential  manipulation of the underlying pool, liquidators may receive fewer assets than expected.

**Recommendation**: 

In both cases users should be able to provide their own slippage tolerance, set as a percentage value of swapped assets.

### Asset is not approved to the zero first 

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example, Tether (USDT)'s `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.
The `_exchangeTokensForExactAmount` function performs a swap calling an `exactOutputSingle` on the Uniswap router. In the case when during the swap not the maximum amount of tokens was used, the current approval for subsequent swap won’t be zero.

FlashLoanLiquidator.sol#L284
```solidity
       require(EIP20Interface(assetToSell).approve(address(SWAP_ROUTER), amountInMaximum), "Liquidator: exchange tokens approve failed");
```

**Recommendation**: 

Set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance and use `safeApprove/safeIncreaseAllowance` instead.


### Oracle freshness threshold can lead to stale data being provided

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The `ChainlinkPriceOracle` contract uses the same hardcoded heartbeat value for all token price feeds, set to 24 hours * 1.1. However, different pairs have different freshness intervals. For instance, the LINK/USD has a heartbeat of 3600 seconds. Additionally, according to the Chainlink documentation, heartbeat can also differ for the same asset across different blockchains. Using the same value for all the price feeds can lead to performing calculations on outdated price data.

**Recommendation**: 

Use the corresponding heartbeat for each token being used.



### Chainlink adapter will return the wrong price if underlying aggregator hits `minAnswer/maxAnswer`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

`ChainlinkAggregators` have a built-in circuit breaker in case prices go outside predetermined `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` price bands. Therefore, if an asset suffers a huge loss in value, such as in case of the LUNA crash, the Chainlink aggregator will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This could allow users to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price.

**Recommendation**: Consider checking if the price returned by the registry is not outside the aggregator’s `minAnswer/maxAnswer` bounds and revert if it is.

### Centralization risks

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In ComptrollerNFTPart1 contract, The functions `_setNFTCollateralFactor()`, `_setNFTCollateralSeizeLiquidationFactor()`, `_setNFTCollateralLiquidationBonusPBX()`, `_setNFTLiquidationExchangePToken()`, `_setNFTXioMarketplaceZapAddress()`, `_setSudoswapPairRouterAddress()`, `_setUniswapV3SwapRouterAddress()`, `_setUniswapWETHAddress()`, `_setNFTModuleClosedBeta()` can be used to change important state variables anytime by the admin. This can lead to unintended bugs if exploited by a malicious admin. 
ComptrollerNFT contracts (including ComptrollerNFTPart1 and ComptrollerNFTPart2) can be changed anytime by the admin. Moreover, the Unitroller address and its implementation, once tied with the ComptrollerNFT contracts (using _become from  ComptrollerNoNFTCommonImpl) can be changed anytime by an admin using _become function again. This can lead to a malicious or compromised admin making malicious changes to the Comptroller and Unitroller contracts without the user's noticing.
Similarly in the ComptrollerNoNFTPart1 contract, the functions: `_setPriceOracle()`, `_setCloseFactor()`, `_setCollateralFactor()`, `_setLiquidationIncentive()`, `_setBorrowCapGuardian()` and `_setPauseGuardian()` can be used to change important state variables anytime by the admin.
Also in the PNFTToken contract, the functions `_setComptroller()`, `_setNFTXioVaultId()` and `_setSudoswapLSSVMPairAddress()` can be used to change the state variables anytime by a malicious admin to exploit the contract.
In the PNFTTokenDelegator contract, the `_setImplementation()` can be used to change the implementation of the contract to a malicious one by a compromised admin.
Similarly the above issue is applicable to the PToken, Governance and Interest rate model contracts. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to utilize at least a 2/3 or a 3/5 Multisig wallet used by different trusted participants or use a secure governance mechanism to decentralize its usage.

**Comments**: The team would be using a multisign wallet (Gnosis Safe) now.  They said that they would be using a governance mechanism in futuew, known from Compound, where users will be able to vote for update proposals. Here the admin address for the contracts they said will be set to the governance contract in the future.


### Outdated interest rate 

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract PToken.sol, the methods `borrowRatePerBlock(...)` and `supplyRatePerBlock(...)` uses interestRateModel contract’s getBorrowRate() and getSupplyRate().

Further,  getBorrowRate() and getSupplyRate() use the `utilizationRate(...)` method to calculate the respective rates. 

Now, utilizationRate method uses the following formula to calculate:
return borrows.mul(1e18).div(cash.add(borrows).sub(reserves));
Which clearly depends on the borrows, cash, and reserves amount. 

Now these variables (borrows, cash, and reserves) are out of date as they need to be updated in accrueInterest() method. Because of this cascading effect, the finally calculated borrow rate and supply rate will be not up-to-date as well.

Recommendation: Call the `accrueInterest()` method in the borrowRatePerBlock(...) and supplyRatePerBlock(...) methods first.

## Low Risk

### Missing flash loan initiator check

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

In the FlashloanLiquidator contract, the liquidate and liquidateFor functions are intended for liquidating the maximum possible amount of collateral. The _liquidateImpl function calls the flashLoanSimple on the Aave pool and receives a callback to executeOperation function, which checks if the Aave pool sent this call. However, an attacker can directly call Aave’s flash loan function on the pool contract, specifying the FlashLoanLiquidator contract's address as the recipient and providing arbitrary arguments.

**Recommendation**: 


Validate that the flash loan has been initiated by the FlashloanLiquidator contract’s functions, which are the intended initiator.

### Inconsistency between PErc20 and PEther interfaces

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

The protocol distinguishes between two types of PTokens: PErc20 and PEther. Both types implement the same functionalities but present behaviors. For instance, the mint function in the PErc20 contract returns an error code, whereas in the PEther contract, this function reverts on failure. This inconsistency is also observed in the repayBorrow, repayBorrowBehalf, and liquidateBorrow functions. Such differences can lead to misconceptions, and it is recommended to enforce uniform behavior for the same routines. 

**Recommendation**: 

Consider ensuring the consistency between those two mentioned types of PToken. 

### Missing error messages

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

In the PNFT token contract, there are missing error messages on line: 812
 require(balanceAfter - balanceBefore == amount); 
And line: 865
require(ComptrollerNFTInterface(newComptroller).isComptroller()); 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add appropriate error messages for better debugging and maintenance of the contracts.

### Missing admin initializations

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

PCryptoPunks and PCryptoPunksDelegate do not have important functionalities implemented, such as setting of the admin. If these contracts are deployed, it could lead to the admin functions and nonreentrant functions being unable to be used. Non Reentrant functions would fail to work because they depend on the initialize function being called first, which can only be called by an admin.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to make PCryptoPunks contract abstract as it does not implement important functionalities such as the setting of admin. Or implement setting of the admin in the respective contracts. 


### Multiple initializations

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

PCryptoPunksImmutable and Perc721 contracts can be initialized multiple times through the initialize() function inherited from the PNFT contract.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to disallow reinitialization of the contract once initialized.


### Missing sanity checks

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the PToken contract, there is missing sanity checks for newProtocolSeizeShareMantissa in the _setProtocolSeizeShareMantissa() function. This could lead to newProtocolSeizeShareMantissa being set to any arbitrary value by a malicious admin and can lead to potential exploits. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add appropriate sanity checks for the same.

### ERC20 race condition

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

There exists an ERC20 race condition in PToken. This could lead to potential frontrun attacks and can lead to an attacker spending more tokens than intended for allowance. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to introduce `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions for the same.

Refer- https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-114/ 

### Unlimited minting of NFTs

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

 PCryptoPunksImmutable allows whitelisted users/minters to mint any amount of NFTs. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to use this whitelist feature to whitelist only trusted entities or introduce a maximum number of NFTs that can be minted by each of these minters to avoid gaming the system.

### PToken double spend race conditions

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract PToken.sol, the method approve(...) is used to allow the spender to transfer a certain amount from the source account.

This method is prone to double-spend attacks. Briefly, an authorized spender could spend both allowances by front-running an allowance-changing transaction. 

**Recommendation**: 

Use OpenZeppelin’s decreaseAllowance and increaseAllowance functions to help mitigate this.



### Missing zero-address check

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract BaseJumpRateModelV2.sol, the constructor is setting `admin` parameter which is not validated for zero-address check. 
In case, the admin is set to address(0) address, the contract will need to be redeployed as no admin methods can be called now. 

This check is missing in the constructors of PEtherImmutable.sol, PEtherDelegator.sol, PErc20Delegator.sol, PErc20Immutable.sol, PCryptoPunksImmutable.sol, and PNFTTokenDelegator.sol contract as well.

Across the protocol in many contracts, `_setPendingAdmin(...)` method allows the admin to set address(0) as the pendingAdmin as there is no validation for zero-address check.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a `require` statement to validate that the given argument is not a zero-address.

Fix 1: The issue is partially fixed.


### Possible overflow in error codes

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract PEther.sol, the method `requireNoError` is using the calculation as follows to calculate the full message.
```solidity
fullMessage[i+2] = byte(uint8(48 + ( uint(err) / 10 )));
```
Here, there is a typecast to uint8 which will keep only the least 8 significant bits, and any errorCode greater than or equal to (256-48)*10 = 2080 will overflow and give an incorrect result.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a comment to have the errorCode be not more than 2080 or use safe type casting

### Single-setting with no Fail-safe Mechanism in `_setPBXToken` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status** : Unresolved 

**Description**

The function `_setPBXToken` in the ComptrollerNoNFTPart1  smart contract allows for the setting of the PBXToken address by the admin. It checks if the PBXToken address has been set previously or not, and also verifies that the provided newPBXTokenAddress is not zero.
However, this function only allows the PBXToken address to be set once. This poses a significant risk in the case of an erroneous entry. In the case where an incorrect PBXToken address is set, the error is permanent and irrevocable, as there is no mechanism to update or correct the PBXToken address. This could potentially lock all the functionalities linked with PBXToken if a wrong address is set.

**Recommendations**:

Add a Fail-safe Mechanism: Implement a fail-safe mechanism that would allow for the PBXToken address to be updated or corrected in the case of an error. This should also be strictly controlled to avoid misuse.
Implement Input Verification: To prevent setting an incorrect PBXToken address, add more strict input verifications. Check the validity of the newPBXTokenAddress before setting it as PBXToken.
Double Confirmation Mechanism: Consider implementing a mechanism that requires the admin to confirm the newPBXTokenAddress more than once before it is set as the PBXToken.

## Informational

### Incorrect naming of external and public functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

The functions _ should be used to name internal functions and not the external functions. In the ComptrollerNFTPart1 contract the functions _setPriceOracle, _setCloseFactor, _setCollateralFactor, _supportMarket, _setMarketBorrowCaps, _setBorrowCapGuardian, _setPauseGuardian, _setMintPausedGlobal, _setMintPaused, _setBorrowPaused, _setBorrowPausedGlobal, _setTransferPaused, _setSeizePaused, _setAllPausedGlobal, _setPBXToken, _setContributorPBXSpeed, etc. are all external and public functions and should not use _ in its name.
The same goes for the functions in other Comptroller, Governance, PNFT and PToken contracts.
**Recommendation**:

It is advised to follow the above naming conventions as suggested being in line with the solidity naming conventions.

### For loop over dynamic array

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the ComptrollerNFTPart1 contract, the looping in a for loop over dynamic array in the _supportNFTMarket() function can lead to out of gas issues and potential denial of service.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add a max limit on the allNFTMarkets length.

### Misleading or Wrong Natspec comments

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In PNFTToken.sol, the comments mention `ERC721 pNFTTokens` as pTokens which are ERC20 tokens. 

In Contracts ComptrollerNFTPart1.sol and ComptrollerNFTPart2.sol, the pNFTToken is mentioned as pTokens.

**Recommendation**: 

Use pNFTToken for NFT Paribus tokens.


### Require statements with no message

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Across the protocol in many contracts, there are several `require` statements that do not have an error message to indicate why the transaction must have failed.

The following are the statements:
```solidity
require(pToken.isPToken());

require(PNFTToken(PNFTTokenAddress).isPNFTToken());


require(pNFTToken.isPNFTToken());
```

**Recommendation**:

Add a message to the require statements.



### Only vetted tokens should be listed

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

It is important to note that if a malicious or poorly-designed token is added to Paribus, it could allow someone to steal all funds entrusted to Paribus.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider making a formal list of properties that a “safe” token should and should not have, and be sure each new token is safe before listing it on Paribus.

### Use specific Solidity compiler version

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Audited contracts use the following floating pragma:
pragma solidity ^0.5.7; 

It allows to compile contracts with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a 
different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.

### Contract check can be bypassed

**Severity**: Informational


**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract PNFTToken.sol, the method isContract(...) checks if any given account is a contract or not. Here it will return a false value when an account is a contract under construction. 

**Recommendation**: 

Dependency on this method should be less for checking the existence of a contract. Another method such as checking `tx.origin == msg.sender` can be used along with it.


### Extensive looping/Nested looping without any upper limit

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Across the protocol in many contracts, nested `for` loops have been used which impacts the gas consumption and contract size. 

- In Contract ComptrollerNoNFTPart2.sol, method claimPBX(...) 
- In Contract ComptrollerNFTPart1.sol, getNFTDepositVale(...)
- In Contract ComptrollerNFTPart2.sol, getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityInternalNFTImpl(...)

**Recommendation**:

Avoid using nested loops in public or external methods to avoid too much gas consumption



### Remove/Resolve TODO comments

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Across the protocol, in many contracts, there are several TODO comments which show unresolved work and advised to remove or resolve before mainnet deployment.

**Recommendation**: 

Resolve or remove the TODO statements.
