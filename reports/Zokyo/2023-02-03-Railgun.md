# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Centralization risk

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Sender.sol - Admin enjoys much authority. The general theme is that admin has power to call several functions like setting the executorL2 and enable the execution of tasks. Some functions can be more highly severe to be left out controlled by one wallet more than other functions.

**Recommendation** 

Apply governance methods / use multisig wallets.
Fix#1: No message or comment from partner about this, stating that multisig are considered to be used (this is necessary to mitigate the effect of that risk).
Fix#2: Partner stated that contracts ownership are intended to be overtaken by governance module. There is a centralization risk if this contract is owned by an EOA, care should be taken to verify that the owner is the governance delegator after deployment to prevent potential for exploits.

### canExecute causes ambiguity

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Executor.sol - executeTask method executes task that result on marking canExecute=false. It is also the case from the perspective of layer-1 that a failed call to Executor::readyTask after a successful Sender::readyTask that ends up having canExecute=false.

**Recommendation** 

Apply an enum instead of bool canExecute that represents 3 states of execution
NotReady
Ready
Executed
Then apply the required checks that validate the states of execution in the relevant methods.

## Low Risk

### Return value not checked

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Sender.sol - In body of readyTask there is unchecked return value of an external interaction


Also, in Executor.sol - In body of redeem(uint256) there is unchecked return value of an external interaction that should return bytes32.


**Recommendation** 

check the returned unit of createRetryableTicket, apply needed validation on that returned value. Also, same with the returned bytes32 of redeem(uint256) or pass the returned value to the caller.

**Fix**:  Methods are returning those returned values

### Unnecessary transferOwnership

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Sender.sol - In body of constructor, transferring ownership to msg.sender is already carried out by base contract's Ownable constructor.


**Recommendation** 

remove that line of code.


### Error messages are long

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Executor.sol - Error messages in the two require statements are long and considered costly in terms of gas.

**Recommendation**

Write shorter error messages
Use custom errors which is the goto choice for developers since solidity v0.8.4 details about this shown here: soliditylang.
**Fix#1** : No fix to address this, there exist more occurrences of long revert messages in Executor.sol. And one occurrence in Sender.sol.

## Informational

### Lock solidity version

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

All contracts, Lock the pragma to a specific version, since not all the EVM compiler versions support all the features, especially the latest ones which are kind of beta versions, So the intended behavior written in code might not be executed as expected. Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, the latest compiler, which may have higher risks of undiscovered bugs.

**Recommendation** 

fix version to 0.8.17 (the version stated in hardhat.config.ts)
**Fix#1**: No change occurred to fix this. Recommendation is to remove the caret to fix the compiler to a specified version. 

### No validation of input address

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Sender.sol - setExecutor(address) does not validate the input to ensure it is non-zero.

**Recommendation** 

add require statement to ensure input address is not equal to address(0).

**Fix**: Method setExecutorL2 is now validating the input address.

### Better return uint256 taskID created

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Executor.sol - createTask does create a new task and emit an event showing info about the task id just created to be referenced later. This might be tiresome for contracts, calling this method createTask to try and deduce the taskID . Contract using that method can know the id by knowing the length of tasks, but this is not straightforward and obvious.

**Recommendation** 

Have the method createTask return the taskID  at the end of the method call.
