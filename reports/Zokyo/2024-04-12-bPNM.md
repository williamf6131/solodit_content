# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Inconsistent Payment Token Handling.

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowldeged

**description**

bpnmMain.sol: _replenishPaymentBalance.

The `_replenishPaymentBalance` function facilitates payment for packs potentially called
within the `activate()` function. Currently, the cost of packs is predefined, presumably in
USDT. If the payment method changes in the future, the cost is not automatically
recalibrated to match the new token's value, leading to discrepancies and possibly incorrect
payment amounts.

**Recommendation**:

Implement a mechanism that adjusts the pack costs dynamically based on the active
payment token. This could involve real-time price feeds or an exchange rate system to
maintain consistent pricing across accepted tokens. Otherwise, verify if the price and
decimals of all payment tokens will be equal (for example, they are stablecoins).

**Post-audit:**
 
The team has acknowledged the issue and assured that only stable coins with the same
decimals will be used (USDT, DAI, etc). Also, initially, only the USDT will be used, and any
other added payment options will be carefully double-checked to correspond to the
requirements.

## Low Risk

### Arbitrary User Activation and Referral Reward Capture.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowldeged

**description**

bpnmMain.sol: activate().
The `activate()` function in the contract allows for a new user registration without strict
validation of its origin. This raises the potential issue that any actor can register a new user
and set themselves as the referrer, thus illegally positioning themselves to receive referral
rewards.

**Recommendation**:

Implement additional checks to ensure that the new user genuinely intends to be referred by

the caller. This could include a confirmation mechanism from the new user or a secure off-
chain process that ensures new user consent before being added to the system with an

associated referrer.

**Post-audit:**

The team has verified that the functionality is used to simplify the onboarding of new users
who are not familiar with Web3. Additionally, abusing the issue won’t grant too many benefits
which is why it is initially marked as low.

## Informational

### Lack of Event Emission.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

Most of the functions in the contracts are missing emitting events, although they change the
state of the contract.
To keep track of historical changes in storage variables, it is recommended that events be
emitted for every change in the functions that modify the storage.

**Recommendation:**

Consider emitting events in all functions where state changes to reflect important changes in
contracts.

### Risk of Tokens Getting Stuck When Sent to Contract Unintentionally.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

Based on the nature and purpose of the contract, the team should consider the case that
Users might accidentally (or purposely, after misreading the flow and dApp interface) send
ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens directly to the contract's balance, resulting in a loss of access to
these assets.
The issue is marked as Info, as it is related to the expected user behavior rather than
contract functioning. So, the possible issue should be listed in the report and require
feedback from the team, though the “rescue” mechanism is not mandatory.

**Recommendation:**

Verify that the dApp will have clear instructions on how users should interact with the
protocol. Consider implementing a “rescue” mechanism that permits the contract owner or
authorized individuals to retrieve tokens accidentally sent to the contract - though with the
appropriate security checks regarding the balance stored via the legitimate flow.

**Post-audit:**

The team has verified that interaction with the code will only happen via the dashboard.
However, we suggest putting a note to notify users not to send funds directly.

### Violations of Solidity Style Guide Conventions - magic numbers.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

Hard-coded constants like:
```solidity
bpnmMain: setNftMintTokenMaxAmount(), line 1769 -> 3000, 10 000;
_buyLimitPack() -> 1e6, 1200, 10, 100;
getBtcPrice() -> 60*60*4;
_uplineBonusDistribution(), line 802 -> 10; after line 843 -> 100;
_depositBonusToUser(), line 923 -> 100*90;
_depositFrozenBonusToUser() -> 100*90;
buyBpnm() -> 100, 10;
sellBpnm() -> 100;
withdrawBalance() -> 100, 1200;
extendMatchingBonus() -> 1200, 100*30;
buyEarnLimitWithGwt() -> 100;
buyPurchaseLimit() -> 100;
buySellLimit() -> 100;
extendLvlMarketingBonus() -> 1200, 10;
PhenomenalConsultants: _calcNftGwtProfit() -> 86400, 100;
phenomenalLiquidityDistributor: performUnlock() -> 10000;
setUnlockPeriod() -> 1 hours.
```
are not self-explanatory or defined as named constants, making it difficult to understand
their meaning or how they were derived.

**Recommendation:**

Replace magic numbers with named constants that provide context and make the code more
maintainable and understandable.

**Post-audit:**

The team has postponed fixing the issue since it is not meant to be public.

### Violations of Solidity Style Guide Conventions - filename and contract name mismatch.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

```solidity
bpnmMain - bpnm;
PhenomenalConsultants - NFT_consultants;
phenomenalLiquidityDistributor - phenomLiquidityDistributor.
```

There is an inconsistency between the filenames and the declared contract names within the
file, which can lead to confusion when maintaining the codebase or conducting further
audits.

**Recommendation:**

Rename the Solidity file to exactly match the contract name inside the file to adhere to
standard naming conventions and improve code maintainability.

**Post-audit:**

New files for contracts were added, which match with contracts’ names.

### Violations of Solidity Style Guide Conventions - confusion naming.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

The presence of variables like `value` and `_value` within the same codebase could cause
confusion.

**Recommendation:**

Align variable naming with the style guide, ensuring that parameters are named clearly
without prefixes or postfix underscores unless indicating scope as per the style guide.

**Post-audit:**

Variable naming wasn't aligned.

### Violations of Solidity Style Guide Conventions - Event and Struct names.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**description**

bpnmMain.sol, PhenomenalConsultants.sol, phenomenalLiquidityDistributor.sol: Various
Events and Structs.
Some events and structs start with a lowercase letter, contrary to the practice of using
uppercase initials to enhance readability and signal their roles as user-defined types.

**Recommendation:**

Refactor the affected event and struct names to start with uppercase letters.

**Post-audit:**

Events were renamed. However, the names of some structs still start with lowercase or
underscore.

### The owner is able to set the URI.


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

PhenomenalConsultants.sol: setBaseURI().
The base URI is the core value of NFTs, which references the images of tokens stored in the
decentralized storage. Since users usually pay to own the image, the base URI remains
immutable to ensure that users won’t lose ownership of the image. However, the function
setBaseURI() allows the contract owner to change this value, potentially changing the
images owned by users.

**Recommendation:**

Verify if the functionality of updating the URI is necessary for the collection. Notify users in
advance if the URI is going to be changed.

**Post-audit:**

The team has verified that the setter is necessary in case the NFT URI is swiped from IPFS.
Additionally, NFT's main value is its immutable rarity level.

### Lack of Validation.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

PhenomenalConsultants.sol: constructor() -> parameters _usdtTokenAddress, _feeCollector,
_gwt, _numberOfTokens;
phenomenalLiquidityDistributor: constructor() -> parameters _btcbTokenAddress,
_bpnmTokenAddress;
bpnmMain: init() -> parameters _depositTokenAddress, _btcbTokenAddress, _contractTree,
_nftCollection, _gwt, collectorBTCB.

The zero check is a standard validation to prevent initializing contracts without valid
addresses and amounts. Before setting them, add necessary checks to ensure that variables
that should not be 0 and none of the addresses are equal to the zero address.

**Recommendation:**

Consider adding the necessary validation.

### Unclear External Interaction.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

phenomenalLiquidityDistributor.sol: performUnlock().
The contract comments in the performUnlock() suggest that it should be called from the
bpnmMain contract. However, there is no explicit enforcement within the code, such as a
modifier or a require statement, to ensure that it is only callable by the bpnmMain contract.
This could lead to confusion or unintended usage, as any address could invoke this function.

**Recommendation:**

If the intention is to restrict the function to being called only by the bpnmMain contract,
introduce a modifier that checks the msg.sender against the authorized contract's address.
Alternatively, if the function is meant to be public and callable by any address, update the
comments to reflect this to avoid ambiguity.

**Post-audit:**

A comment was added explaining that anyone can call the function.

### Redundant Calculations.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

bpnmMain.sol: _buyLimitPack(), lines 639, 641.
There are lines within the function where calculations are repeated unnecessarily, which can
lead to inefficiencies in contract execution.

**Recommendation:**

Optimize the function by storing the calculation result in a temporary variable and reusing it
in subsequent operations to reduce redundant processing and gas costs.

### Testnet Code Remnant in Production Smart Contract.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**


bpnmMain.sol: getBtcPrice().

The function contains hardcoded values intended for testnet use, which is noticeable in pre-
production smart contract code. While convenient during the development and testing

phases, such code should be removed or replaced with production-ready mechanisms
before deployment.

**Recommendation:**

Ensure that the testnet-specific code is removed before deployment.

### Potential Optimization - Unnecessary Token Balance Checks.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**


bpnmMain.sol: buyBpnm(), withdrawBalance(), extendMatchingBonus().
Several functions perform explicit balance checks for a user's token holdings, as the ERC20
`transfer` and `transferFrom` functions revert the transaction if the balance is insufficient.
These preliminary checks could be removed to simplify the code and save on gas costs
without sacrificing security.

**Recommendation:**

Remove the redundant token balance validations in functions.
Post-audit. The balance checks are necessary for easier transaction analysis. Since
transactions on BSC don't cost much, leaving the checks will not significantly increase
transaction costs.

### Potential Optimization - by Caching Value.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**


bpnmMain.sol: bpnmPrice().
The value calculated by the bpnmPrice() function could be reused within transactional
operations instead of recalculating multiple times. Currently, the function is called repeatedly
in different parts of the contract, which may result in unnecessary gas spending.

**Recommendation:**

Cache the result of bpnmPrice() in a memory variable during transactions where multiple
price lookups occur.

### Potential Optimization - Conditional Checks.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

bpnmMain.sol: _uplineBonusDistribution().
The function's series of if statements iterate through upline user bonus calculations without
utilizing an `if-else` structure. This leads to multiple unnecessary checks even after a
matching condition is found, leading to suboptimal gas usage.

**Recommendation:**

Refactor the _uplineBonusDistribution() function to employ an `if-else` to break out of the
conditional checks once a matching condition is met.

### Potential Optimization - Unnecessary Validation Checks for Unsigned Integer Parameters.


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

Several functions throughout the bpnmMain contract verify that the unsigned integer
parameters are greater than or equal to zero. This is unnecessary as the uint256 datatype
inherently guarantees that the value cannot be negative. This tautological condition results
in redundant code and gas wastage during execution.
Examples of this issue are prevalent in functions such as _getPaymentContract,
releaseFrozenFunds, addressFrozenTotal, setBtcOracle, setBpnmBuyFee, setBpnmSellFee,
and setgwtTransFeeLiquidity, all of which contain the unnecessary comparison against zero
for uint256 parameters.

**Recommendation:**

Remove checks like this `paymentID >= 0` from the required statements in the respective
functions.

### Potential Optimization - Inefficient State Variable Declaration (not immutable).

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

phenomenalLiquidityDistributor: btcb, bpnm;
PhenomenalConsultants: feeCollector, gwt, numberOfTokens, usdt.
The contracts define state variables set during contract deployment and do not change
afterward. However, these variables are not currently marked as immutable, meaning they
can be more gas-intensive to access than necessary.

**Recommendation:**

Mark described state variables with the immutable keyword where they are declared.

### Potential Optimization - Inefficient State Variable Declaration (not constant).

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

bpnmMain: _binanceBtcOracle, _chainLinkBtcOracle.
Described addresses are set at deployment and are intended to remain unchanged for the
contract's lifetime. Not declaring these as constant results in unnecessary gas costs every
time they are accessed.

**Recommendation:**

If the intent is for _binanceBtcOracle and _chainLinkBtcOracle to remain static and not to be
updated post-deployment, mark these variables as constant.

### Incentive Misalignment in Maximum Pack Purchases.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

bpnmMain.sol: _buyLimitPack().
Currently, purchasing the maximum available limit pack seems less profitable than buying
smaller packs sequentially due to the lack of cumulative bonuses from previous packs.
Additionally, the system does not allow downgrading the pack ID, which may discourage
purchasing larger packs upfront.

**Recommendation:**

Adjust the bonus system to account for cumulative rewards when users purchase larger
packs or introduce the ability to downgrade packID, providing more flexibility and fair
incentives to users at all investment levels.

**Post-audit:**

The team has verified that high-limit packs grant access to lower tree levels, so the profit is
significantly bigger when getting bonuses from lower tree levels. Getting people on that level
takes some time, so lower packages give more profits at the beginning, but later, when tree
level depth grows, higher packages give more profit while decreasing limits to increase the
flow of liquidity for token price growth.

### Storage of Claim Links for Purchased Items.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

bpnmMain.sol.
The contract stores the claim links for purchased marketplace items in the smart contract
storage, which raises accessibility concerns. Given that these links are stored on-chain, they
are publicly visible, and anyone can potentially access the URLs without needing to execute
the purchase function and without validating ownership of the related item.

**Recommendation:**

Verify the necessity of storing claim links directly within the blockchain. If the links must
stay private or only accessible to legitimate purchasers, consider alternative approaches.

**Post-audit:**

The front end will use an authorization layer via wallet to verify that the user has bought the
item.

### Custom errors should be used.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

Starting from the 0.8.4 version of Solidity it is recommended to use custom errors instead of
storing error message strings in storage and use “require” statements. Using custom errors is
more efficient regarding gas spending and increases code readability.

**Recommendation:**

Use custom errors.

**Post-audit:**

The team has acknowledged the issue, and since most of Dapp is already implemented,
custom errors will not be implemented.

### Inefficient Use of Arithmetic Operations.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

Several times throughout the smart contracts, division operations are immediately followed
by multiplication within the same formula. This ordering can sometimes lead to unnecessary
precision loss due to Solidity's truncation behavior when handling integer divisions. This is a
concern in financial calculations where every currency unit is significant.

**Recommendation:**

Review the arithmetic order of operations in financial formulas throughout the smart
contracts. Consider restructuring calculations to perform multiplication before dividing to
minimize precision loss. For example, adjust `a / b * c` to `a * c / b`, ensuring the
multiplication does not overflow the variable's capacity.

**Post-audit:**

Calculations were restructured everywhere except:
BEP20BPNM.sol: buyBpnm() -> lines 1059, 1061;
PhenomenalLiquidityDistributor.sol: performUnlock() -> line 79.

### Redundant Contract Copies in the Repository.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

A recent review of the fixed contracts found that multiple copies of the same contract were
left in the repository. This may confuse determining the current, active version of any given
contract.

**Recommendation:**

Remove outdated or redundant contract copies from the repository.

### Mismatch in Calculation Compared to Comment Description.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

bpnmMain.sol: _uplineBonusDistribution(), line 800.
The code within the function divides the processed amount by 10, which implies that each
address should receive 10% of the bonus pool. However, the comment indicates that each
address is supposed to receive 0.5% from a 5% bonus pool. Based on the comment's
description, the current implementation would result in each address receiving a significantly
higher bonus than intended.

**Recommendation:**

Align the matching bonus distribution logic within the function to match the percentage
described in the comments.
Post-audit. The team has verified that the functionality is working as intended.

### Multiple Purchases of the Same Marketplace Item by Different Users.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

bpnmMain.sol: purchaseMarketplaceItem().
The function allows multiple users to purchase the same item from the marketplace. This
could be either intentional, allowing limitless sales of a digital product, or an oversight if the
item should be unique or have limited availability.

**Recommendation:**

Verify if the ability for numerous users to purchase the same item aligns with the intended
marketplace logic. If items are meant to be unique or have limited quantities, implement a
tracking system to decrease the available quantity upon each purchase or restrict further
purchases once sold out.

**Post-audit:**

According to the team, this is intentional functionality. If an item is out of stock, the seller
will have to disable it.

### Inconsistencies with the whitepaper.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

1) For the 4th tree level in the whitepaper, the following values are set: Percentage reserved from bonus size - 80, and Maximum reserve period in days - 2. But in the bpnmMain contract the set values for these items are 0, 0.;
2) In bpnmMain matchingBonusGwtCost is set to 200 by defau0t, although 500 is indicated in the whitepaper.;
3) For nftDiscountForWithdraw, the contract in the commentary indicates a maximum of 5%, although, in the whitepaper, it is 50%.
**Note:**
This issue is marked as info because the discrepancies do not threaten the contract's 
immediate functionality or security. However, they indicates potential misalignment between 
the project's documentation and its technical implementation, which could lead to confusion 
among users and stakeho0ders.

**Recommendation**:

Review and update contract values to accurately reflect the project's intended design as per the whitepaper, or vice versa, to maintain consistenly and clear expectations.

**Post-audit:**

The team has verified the issue so that:
1) Mistake in whitepaper. Initia00y, These settings were intended but then realized that lvl4 is opened on the lowest limit pack, so funds Han never be frozen there. Will remove the numers for the 4 levels from the whitepaper
2) This is because the default value would be 500, but at the beginning, prestart is  activated, which would be 200 at prestart. Later, it will be increased to 500 to match the  whitepaper numer.
3) This depends on what amount to calculate. In contrast, 5% means the absolute  withdrawal amount, which is more correct for developers to understand. In the  whitepaper, it is stated as 50% of the applied fee (because the fee is 10% of the asolute  amount), which is easier for users to understand. So, basically, the max fee is 10% of the absolute amount, from which half can be compensated with NFT ownership.
