## Medium Risk

###  Possibility of Slippage Attacks 

**Severity**: Medium 

**Status** : Acknowledged 

**Description**: 

No slippage has been set during swapping of tokens in the function `swapTokensForEth()`. This could lead to the user being vulnerable to slippage attacks in which an attacker can manipulate the prices and frontrun and backrun the user such that the user gets much lesser amount of tokens than expected. See line: 823 for the same.

```solidity
uniswapV2Router.swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
            tokenAmount,
            0, // accept any amount of ETH
            path,
            address(this),
            block.timestamp
        );
```
This happens due to the fact that 0 value has been passed for the `amountOutMin` parameter of the `swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens()` function. 

**Recommendation**: 

In order to fix this issue, it is advised to set proper slippage value. This would mean dynamically calculating the `amountOutMin` parameter by letting the user specify the slippage value/percentage that they want to use. Note that setting a hardcoded value here for slippage could result in freezing of users funds in times of high volatility.

 ## Low Risk

 ### Missing Max Limit for Fees

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

There is missing sanity checks for function parameter `_buyFee` and `_sellFee` of the `updateFees()` function. The `_buyFee` and `_sellFee` can be set arbitrarily high, which can result in almost all of the amount(on which the fees is levied) being paid in fees.
       
**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add a max limit for `buyFee` and `sellFee`. 

### Missing Zero Address Check

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

Missing zero address checks for parameter pair of the function `setAutomatedMarketMakerPair()`. This could lead to zero address being accidentally set to true for `automatedMarketMakerPairs[]` mapping and can lead to unintended issues.
       
**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add a zero address require check for the same.


### No Validation on the feeWallet Address

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

The `_updateFeeWallet` function allows setting the `feeWallet` without any validation if it's a valid address or not. It's possible to set it to the zero address or another potentially harmful address.
An incorrect fee wallet address, like the zero address, could cause funds to become irretrievable.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement checks to validate the provided `feeWallet` address before setting it.

### Ownership-Based Function Controls

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

Functions like `enableTrading`, `removeLimits`, and `updateSwapEnabled` are controlled solely based on contract ownership. If the owner's address is compromised, it could lead to catastrophic consequences.
If the owner's address is compromised, an attacker could halt trading, change critical contract parameters, or even drain funds.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a multi-signature or DAO-based control for critical functions rather than relying solely on the `onlyOwner` modifier.

## Informational

### Lack of Events for Critical Changes

**Severity**: Informational 

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

Some critical state changes, like updateSwapEnabled or enableTrading, don't emit events. This makes it harder for external systems to track the contract's actions and state changes.

**Recommendation**: 

Emit descriptive events for all state-changing functions in the contract.
 


### Redundant Check for Zero Address in `_transfer` Function

**Severity**: Informational 

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The  `_transfer` function in the provided in nerd token contains a redundant check for the zero address. Initially, the function checks if the to address is the zero address using a require statement. However, further into the function, there's another check for the zero address within a compound if condition.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the redundant check for the zero address in the compound if statement. The initial require statement is sufficient to prevent transfers to the zero address.
