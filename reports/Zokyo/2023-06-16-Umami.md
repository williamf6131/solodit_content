## High Risk

### Price manipulation through Uniswap pool

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract UniswapV3SwapManager, the swap of tokens is done through the _swapTokenExactInput function, which first create the necessary parameters for the swap and then call the function exactInput from the Uniswap V3 Router. To swap tokens, uniswap is using liquidity pools, the pools are organized in different fee tiers, at the beginning there we’re 3 tiers ( 0,05%, 0,3%, 1% ), after a governance vote, they have also added the option for the 0.01% fee tier. The likelihood of adding new pools in the future and liquidity migrating to it or the change of non-existing pool is create an possible attack vector in this case. UniswapV3SwapManager is generating the swap path inside the _getSwapPath, it is also taking into consideration the existence of an intermediaryAsset for the easy of swap in case there are no available pairs
Let’s take the following example : 
Let’s say you want to swap LUSD with WETH and the intermediaryAsset is WETH, the usual fee for the WETH intermediayAsset is 0.05% because you noticed there is the most liquidity inthe majority of the pool, however in the case of LUSD-WETH pool, all of the liquidity is in the 0,3% pool, 1% and 0,05% pools liquidity is almost non-existent and the pool for 0,01% does not exist ( which means it can be created and manipulated by an attacker ), this will expose the protocol to a price manipulation attack that can result in either loss of funds or dos. 
Let’s say you want to swap USDT with USDC, intermediaryAsset is WETH, most of the liquidity in USDC-WETH is in the 0,05% pool, so is the case for USDT-WETH, however the pool for USDC-USDT pair with the biggest liquidity is the 0,01% fee, if you would go directly to the to the last pool, you will also benefit from a higher liquidity but you will also have a cheaper fee which will help you save funds, an clear example why pre-configuration of fee tires is not always a good decision. 
Let’s say you want to swap USDC-USDT, you initially configured for the 0,05% fee tier and everything is going fine, hoverwer a few months in the future the Uniswap dao governance vote to add another tier pool of 0,0% fees and all the liquidity will migrate to that pool, opening the protocol again to price manipulation attacks. 

**Recommendation**: 

To ensure the protocol is working properly no matter the conditions, drop the mechanism of fees configuration and dynamically look for the pool with the hight liquidity when creating the swap path.


### Unchecked shares can lead to stolen assets

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract AssetVaults, function `withdraw` takes as input parameters some assets, the receiver of the withdrawed assets and the shares owner. The first step is to add the withdrawal fees to the assets then convert the amount of assets + fees to shares after that  check the allowances over that shares in case the msg.sender is different from owner, burn the shares and transfer the assets to the receiver and the fees to the fees recipient.
This function have 3 low level weak points that an attacker can chain to withdraw assets without even owning any shares. 
The weakpoints: 
Allowance checking using a math formula and making the assumption it will revert thanks to the underflow. 
Rounding down of the assets inside the assetToShares function
Not sanity checking the outputed value that represents the “shares”

**Scenario** : 

Price per share is 1000e6 ( 1k usdc ), usdc is 6 decimals and there are plantly of assets inside the vault 
A malicious attacker that have never owned any shares or deposited any assets call the withdraw function with the following parameters assets = 8e2 - fees ( for a simplified example ), receiver = attacker address , owner = any address 
The first step inside the logic is to first add the fees to the assets, as we we’re saying in the above point, the assets = 8e2-fees so assets + fees = 8e2
Now the contract converts from assets to shares using the function “assetsToShares”, and the math formula will be like this: 8e2 * 1e6 / 1000e6 = 0 ( because of the rounding down ), so variable ‘shares’  will have value  0
Now the logic goes further inside the if condition because the msg.sedner != owner, it takes the allowances of the msg.sender over the owner and stores it in variable allowed, which will be 0, now the logic is backfilling on the assumption that the execution will revert with an underflow because allowed - shares => underflow revert if allowed is 0, however as shares is also 0, it will be 0 - 0 = 0 which will not revert and continue the execution.
Now it will burn 0 shares from the owner, and as the ERC4626 version you are using is coming from the solmate library and is prioritizing gas consumption there is no check inside it that will prevent the burning of 0 assets. 
The execution continue inside the aggregateVault and it will transfer the assets to the attack and the fees to the fee recipient. 
This attack could be run inside a for loop in one transaction and use dark pools or flashbots and other MEV techniques to send multiple transactions and acaparte multiple blocks to create a bigger financial drain, also the Price Per Share is a very important factor here, the bigger it is ( price per share ) the easier it is to attack because you can use a bigger value for assets and still achieve a roun down that will lead to shares being 0

**Recommendation**:

 Add a sanity check to ensure shares can not be 0
Put the allowance check logic inside an internal function as it is used a lot around the code and it is just copy-pasted ( redundant ) and add a sanity check to revert if allowed = 0 




## Medium Risk

### Unchecked _amountOut can lead to 100% slippage

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract AaveUtilsl, function `_tokenSwapOutAmount` will return in 0 when the token amount is a small value, resulting in an swap with a _minOut of 0 which on it’s on with lead to a swap with 100% slippage which can be easily sandwich by a MEV bot for profit.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check for the to ensure the output of `_tokenSwapOutAmount` and _minOut can never be 0.







### Possible call to zero address

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the GmxAccountManager contract, when the _executeAccountSet function is used to make external calls to each account using assembly, the calls will still be executed even if some of the accounts have not been set properly (i.e., have a zero address). In this case, the execution will not be reverted..

**Recommendation**: 

To ensure proper behavior, add a sanity check to ensure the target address is different from address(0).





### High hardcoded tolerance (slippage)

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the AaavePositionManager contract  the swap `TOLERANCE_BIPS` in bips is hardcoded to a high value (2%) relative to the usual slippage (0.5%) present in swap transactions. This can lead to smaller than expected out amounts given the in amount and it will make the contract an open target for MEV extractors that are using sandwich attacks. 

**Recommendation**: 

Allow for this value to be configurable at least at contract level in case it needs adjustments and start with an value of 0.5% for it.

## Low Risk

### Possible zero address for intermediary asset

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the AaavePositionManager contract the `intermediaryAsset` field inside the Config struct can be zero address. This leads will revert the call inside the uniswap contract, at function exactInputInternal #101r. 

**Recommendation**: 

Set this value while deploying the contract or make sure it’s non zero before making the uniswap call.





### AavePositionManager compatibility with Vaults might fail in some edge cases

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Aave V3 is configured to work with a few selected tokens, and the mixed of selected tokens is different on each chain, on the arbitrum chain the UNI tokens is not supported on Aave V3, the oracle will revert if you even try to fetch prices for it, however it is available on ethereum mainne version of Aave V3. 
If one of the Umami vaults will use UNI tokens as the underlying asset, that liquidity will not be compatible with AavePositionManager handler. 

**Recommendation**: 

Ensure a strategy where only selected vaults will work with compatible handlers to not let Keepers have surprises. 


## Informational 

### Constant not used anywhere in code

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract AaveUtils, constant INTEREST_RATE_MODE_STABLE is declared correctly as the stable more rate inside the Aave protocol is identified using the integer 1,  however is never used inside Umami products  .

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the constant if you don’t intend to use it.

 
### Cap deposit invariant is not as expected

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

In contract AssetVault, the deposit and mint functionalities have a hard cap to not allow the deposit of new assets after a certain amount, however the logic inside that condition (invariant) is not as you would expected, usually a cap needs to be hitted, here the cap can never be hitted because the sum of ‘tvl + assets’ always needs to be smaller than the cap for the deposit to succeed.

**Recommendation**: 

Refactor the sign < (smaller ) inside the condition to <= (smaller or equal ) to allow the vault to hit its cap.
 
 
### Decrease position should not call _getOrCreateAccount

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the AaavePositionManager contract the `_decreasePosition` function retrieves the Aave position account by calling `_getOrCreateAccount` function. The call to that function is redundant and unexpected in the given context, as it should call the `_getAccountOrRevert` function which reverts in case of an inexistent position instead of creating one.

**Recommendation**: 

Change the call to `_getAccountOrRevert`  as it makes more sense in the context.
 
 
### Check for totalSupply equal 0 inside the withdraw function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the AssetVault contract, inside the “withdraw function, before converting the assets to shares, is checking if totalSupply = 0, this check is redundant because if totalSupply si equal with 0, there are no shares or assets to withdraw as the shares will be minted through the deposit and mint function and they will be burned throug the _burn function  and the totalSupply variable is only incremented during the minting (of shares ) and decremented over the burning of shares 

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the check totalSupply = 0 as it is not necessary.


### The fee for the flash loan is not checked

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the AaavePositionManager contract, specifically in the `receiveFlashLoan` function, it is important to ensure that the payment for the loan, which includes an additional fee on top of the borrowed amount, does not exceed a predetermined percentage of the loan amount. This fee, determined by a function parameter and based on an external protocol, needs to be checked to mitigate the risk of potential overcharging and protect the system from unexpected or excessive fees during flash loan transactions. Right now the balancer vault fee is 0, however that can change in the future and you need to have a protocol that is antifragile.

**Recommendation**: 

Define a constant or configurable parameter that represents the maximum allowable fee percentage. For example, you might set it to 1% or any other appropriate value. Verify that the fee amount does not exceed the predetermined percentage of the loan amount.
