# Findings

## High Risk

### Facilitators can borrow assets and never repay it back

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

It is mentioned in the documentation that a `Facilitator` has the capability to borrow assets from the `vault`. However, upon reviewing the `AdvancedOrderEngine` smart contract, no mechanism for verifying whether the borrowed assets have been repaid by the Facilitator is observed.
Without proper checks in place, there is a high possibility of assets being borrowed without repayment, leading to potential loss within the system.

**File**: AdvancedOrderEngine.sol

```solidity
701:     function _processFacilitatorInteraction(
702:         bytes calldata facilitatorInteraction,
703:         OrderEngine.Order[] calldata orders,
704:         uint256[] calldata executedSellAmounts,
705:         uint256[] calldata executedBuyAmounts,
706:         ERC20[] calldata borrowedTokens,
707:         uint256[] calldata borrowedAmounts
708:     ) private {
..
724:             // Transfer funds to the 'interactionTarget' address.
725:             for (uint256 i; i < borrowedTokens.length; ) {
726:                 _sendAsset(
727:                     borrowedTokens[i],
728:                     borrowedAmounts[i],
729:                     interactionTarget
730:                 );
731:                 unchecked {
732:                     ++i;
733:                 }
734:             }

```

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check to validate that the borrowed assets have been repaid by the Facilitator.

**Client comment**: 

**Defense Reason**: Design Choice.
**DEFENSE**: Consider the following example



User1
User2
User3
SELL
10 USDC
11 USDC
0.0096 ETH
BUY
0.0048 ETH
0.0048 ETH
20 USDC


In this situation, User3's order will satisfy both User1’s and User2’s orders. Here’s how it works:
- User3 sells 0.0096 ETH, which fulfills User1’s and User2’s requests to buy 0.0048 ETH each.
- In this chain trade, there will be 1 extra USDC token left.

Why does the facilitator get an incentive?

- **Facilitator Incentive**: Facilitators (bots) are rewarded with the extra token for their service. This incentive mechanism ensures that anyone can create these bots, whitelist them, and start matching orders in our distributed architecture.
- **No Unpaid Borrowing**: Facilitators cannot borrow assets without repaying. Users will always receive their specified buy amount. Any extra token is an incentive for the facilitator's service.
- **Comparison with CoW Swap**: On platforms like CoW Swap, solvers (facilitators) can keep the extra token, but there is an additional layer. If the solver willingly foregoes the extra token, their match is accepted, and they are awarded CoW tokens as an incentive.





**Auditors comment**: We have reviewed the explanation provided by the client and accept that this is the intended design choice.

## Medium Risk

### Centralization Risk Due to Overpowered Owner

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The `AdvancedOrderEngine` smart contract grants significant control to the contract owner through several `onlyOwner` functions. This centralization poses a risk as it places considerable trust and control in a single entity. If the owner's private key is compromised, it could lead to significant disruptions or misuse of the contract.

**OnlyOwner Functions**:

- manageOperatorPrivileges() Owner can add or remove operators.
- updateTokenWhitelist() Owner can add or remove tokens from the whitelist.
- changePredicateAddress() Owner can change the predicate address.
- changeFeeCollectorAddress() Owner can change the fee collecter address.
- setMinimumFee() Owner can set the minumum fee.
- withdraw() Owner can withdraw leftover tokens.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a multi-signature wallet for executing onlyOwner functions. This requires multiple authorized signatures to approve critical actions, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

**Client comment**: Ownership will be transferred to a multisig after deployment

### Missing Handling for Tokens with Transfer Fees in `fillOrders()`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: AdvancedOrderEngine.sol

**Description**

The `fillOrders()` function in `AdvancedOrderEngine.sol` does not account for tokens that force a fee on transfers, such as USDT. This results in a discrepancy in token balances after order fulfillment, breaking the invariant that the vault must not retain nor leak funds post-fulfillment of orders: The vault must not keep funds after the fullfilment of orders. I.e `balance[before] == balance[after]`.

**Recommendation**: 

Updated the `fulfillOrders()` function to correctly handle tokens with transfer fees. Ensure that the protocol accounts for fees when calculating token balances post-fulfillment of orders to avoid the vault leaking funds. Carefully picking tokens that do not impost fee-on-transfer is a solution to be considered.

**Client comment**:  

**Defense Reason**: Design Choice.
**Defense**: 
**Whitelisted Tokens Only**:
- Our platform exclusively supports whitelisted tokens, ensuring that only pre-approved tokens are used within the system. This significantly reduces the risk of encountering tokens with unexpected transfer fees.
**Specific Issue with USDT:**
- The primary concern revolves around USDT, as it is currently the main token with a transfer fee. We acknowledge this limitation and have plans in place to address it when necessary.
**Future Adaptability**:
- When USDT or any other token introduces a transfer fee, we have the flexibility to deploy a new contract. This is feasible because our current contract does not store significant data; it primarily functions as a gateway to validate orders before execution.
**Simplification and Complexity Management**:
- Handling tokens with transfer fees introduces additional complexity into the contract logic. To maintain the system's simplicity and reliability, we have decided not to address this issue at the present moment. This decision allows us to focus on core functionalities and ensure robust performance for the majority of use cases.

  


### Orders Might Revert Since Fee Is Optional

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Description**

feeAmounts on orders are supposed to be optional (L12 OrderEngine.sol) meaning orders can have 0 as feeAmounts too. 
When an order is processed (in full or partial) the function _validateFee is used to validate the fee with respect to the minimum fee , but if an order has 0 as feeAmounts the call to _validateFee would revert (this is because executedFeeAmount would be calculated as 0 at L611 and the condition at L654 would revert) . Therefore , it would be impossible to process such an order.

**Recommendation**:

Only call `_validateFee` if `order.feeAmounts > 0`

**Client comment**: 

**Defense**: When we say that fee is optional it means that protocol owners have the option to forgo the fee or to set one the check `_validateFee if order.feeAmounts > 0` is important because we want to ensure that the protocol’s demanded fee is being paid



### `filledSellAmount` Would Be Incorrect For Fee-On-Transfer Tokens

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Description**

When an order is filled partially `_processPartiallyFillableOrder()` is invoked at L477 , and updated `filledSellAmount` by `executedSellAmount` at L608. 
The assets are transferred at L527 (order maker transfers ) where the amount is `executedSellAmount` but since the token is a fee-on-transfer token the actual sent amount would be less than `executedSellAmount` and the update at L477 would be incorrect.

**Recommendation**: 

Handle fee-on-transfer tokens carefully or have a blacklist for such tokens.

**Client comment**: For now we are not handling this case, because it adds an extra layer of complexity. Once usdt enables fee-on-transfer, we will deploy v2 if needed. For other tokens, they will simply not be whitelisted



### `getUsdPrice` WILL NOT WORK WITH COMPLEX/LARGE PATHS

**Severity**: Medium	

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The intended behavior of the `getUsdPrice()` function in `UsdOracle.sol` is to return the amount in USDT, given a token, a token amount, and a period.

The current implementation of `getUsdPrice()` will only work if there is either a direct pool of the given token and USDT, or if there is an available path in the form of token-WETH-USDT. This means that if the given token does not have a direct pool with WETH or USDT, then it will not be possible to calculate a reliable USDT amount


**Recommendation**:

If other paths are to be considered for USD conversion calculation, then the implementation should be changed to allow for such behavior.


**Client comment**: This helper contract is used on the backend for matchmaking purposes. Since a token must have a pair with either WETH or USDT to exist on ElektrikDex, our design ensures reliable and consistent price calculations. On our frontend, we will only use whitelisted tokens that meet this criterion. This assumption and requirement have now been clearly documented within the contract to prevent any ambiguity. This approach simplifies the system and aligns with our use case, which does not require handling additional token paths for USD conversion.



### TWAP CAN BE MANIPULATED IF THE PERIOD IS SHORT ENOUGH

**Severity**: Medium	

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The function `getUsdPrice` in `UsdOracle.sol` is used for converting an amount of token to usd. This function gets `_period` as input. `_period` is the number of seconds from which to calculate the TWAP. If `_period` is set to a short value then the price can be manipulated.


**Recommendation**:

Add a check that ensures that `_period` is at least 30 minutes to avoid price manipulation.

**Client comment**: 

Oracle contract is a helper contract, and we want it to be as flexible as possible. Also we are using the same contract at frontend for spot prices. Where twap manipulation is concerned the back-end will send the period as 30

## Low Risk

### USE A MULTISIG ACCOUNT FOR THE OWNER

**Severity**: Low	

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The functions `updateUsdt()`, `updateWeth()`, `updateOracle()` are onlyOwner callable. It means that the owner has the power of changing important variable values for the core behavior so it is recommendable to use a multisig account in order to avoid updating these variable by error or to avoid getting owner account compromised.

```solidity
function updateUsdt(address _usdt) external onlyOwner {
       usdt = _usdt;
   } 

   function updateWeth(address _weth) external onlyOwner {
       weth = _weth;
   } 

   function updateOracle(address _oracle) external onlyOwner {
       oracle = IStaticOracle(_oracle);
   } 
```



**Recommendation**:

Use a multi-sig wallet with a timelock as the owner.
Client comment: Ownership transfer after deployment


### LACK OF EVENTS

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the UsdOracle contract, the `updateUsdt()`, `updateWeth()`, and `updateOracle()` functions don’t emit events when key values are updated.

**Recommendation**: 

Add events according to the states to be updated.


### MISSING SANITY CHECKS FOR IMPORTANT VARIABLES

**Severity**: Low	

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

There are some important variables in the `UsdOracle.sol` contract that are not checked before being set in the constructor and also in the functions used for updating their values.

**Recommendation**:

Add a check to ensure that the set values for `usdt`, `weth` and `oracle` in the constructor and in `updateUsdt()`, `updateWeth()` and `updateOracle()` and not equal to address(0).


### Temporary DOS if one order contained a blacklisted address

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The `fillOrders()` function in the `AdvancedOrderEngine` smart contract will revert the entire transaction if it encounters an order that contains a blacklisted address from a token like USDC. This behavior could disrupt the processing of valid orders and lead to inefficiencies, especially if the transaction includes multiple orders and only one is problematic.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider skipping orders that have a blacklisted address and process the rest e.g. use continue rather than revert. or use an off-chain monitoring service to keep track of blacklisted addresses used by the protocol
**Client comment**: Backend will be responsible to first simulate and then submit the order, if a case arises, where a blacklisted address submits and order the backend will be responsible to choose a different candidate's order 


### Owner can renounce ownership

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Ownable2Step and Ownable contracts includes a function named `renounceOwnership()` which can be used to remove the ownership of the contract. 
If this function is called on the `AdvancedOrderEngine` contract, it will result in the contract becoming disowned. This would subsequently break several critical functions of the protocol that rely on onlyOwner modifier like:

- manageOperatorPrivileges()
- updateTokenWhitelist()
- changePredicateAddress()
- changeFeeCollectorAddress()
- setMinimumFee()
- withdraw()



**Recommendation**: 

override the function to disable its functionality, ensuring the contract cannot be disowned e.g.
```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public override onlyOwner { 
revert ("renounceOwnership is disabled"); 
}
```


### Improper Order of Modifiers in `fillOrders()`

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `fillOrders()` function of `AdvancedOrderEngine` contract currently places the nonReentrant modifier after the onlyOperator modifier. The order of modifiers can influence the behavior of a function, and it is generally recommended to place the nonReentrant modifier before other modifiers to ensure reentrancy protection is applied first.
```solidity
File: AdvancedOrderEngine.sol
311:     function fillOrders(
..
319:     ) external onlyOperator nonReentrant {
```

**Recommendation**: 

Reorder the modifiers so that nonReentrant is placed before onlyOperator. This ensures that reentrancy protection is applied as the first check.



### Misleading Documentation for recipient Address Handling

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The documentation for the `AdvancedOrderEngine` contract here specifies that if a user wants the recipient address to be the same as the maker address, they should set the recipient address to the null address (address(0)). However, the smart contract implementation reverts the transaction if the recipient address is the null address, leading to a discrepancy between the documentation and the actual behavior of the contract.


**File**: AdvancedOrderEngine.sol

```solidity
533:     function _validateOrder(
534:         OrderEngine.Order calldata order,
535:         uint256 executedSellAmount,
536:         uint256 executedBuyAmount,
537:         bytes32 orderHash
538:     ) private view {
..
569:         // Revert if any address in the order is zero.
570:         if (
571:             order.maker == address(0) ||
572:             order.buyToken == address(0) ||
573:             order.sellToken == address(0) ||
574:             order.recipient == address(0)  
575:         ) {
576:             revert ZeroAddress();
577:         }
```
**Recommendation**: 

Align the contract behavior with the documentation or update the documentation to reflect the actual behavior of the contract.


### Missing Sanity checks 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

It was found that the constructor of the Airdrops.sol smart contract does not include checks to validate the provided parameters are not zero. Although this is not critical, failing to perform this validation can lead to unexpected behaviors, specially because there are no setter functionalities in the contract to update the variables values.

**File**: Airdrops.sol
```solidity
30:     constructor(bytes32 _merkleRoot, address _rewardContract) { 
31:         merkleRoot = _merkleRoot;
32:         rewardContract = _rewardContract;
33:     }  
```

 **Recommendation**: 
 
 it is recommended to implement a check within the constructor to ensure that the provided parameters are not zero.



### `rewardContract` and `merkleRoot` Cannot be updated

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `Airdrops.sol` smart contract does not provide setter functions for updating the `rewardContract` and `merkleRoot` after deployment. This design choice ensures immutability, but it also means that if an incorrect values are provided during the deployment of the contract to the constructor, these variables cannot be updated, potentially rendering the contract non-functional.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider adding an `onlyOwner` protected setter functions to update the rewardContract and merkleRoot in case incorrect values are provided during deployment.





### Incorrect Event Emission in Constructor

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: AdvancedOrderEngine.sol

**Description**

The `feeCollectorAddr` parameter is incorrectly emitted as part of the `PredicatesChanged` event in the constructor of the `AdvancedOrderEngine` contract, where it should be `predicatesAddr` instead.
```solidity
emit PredicatesChanged(address(0), feeCollectorAddr);
```

**Recommendation**: 

Update the event emission in the constructor to correctly emit predicatesAddr instead of feeCollectorAddr to accurately reflect the changes made.

### Missing Context Header in for merkle proof

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: Airdrops.sol

**Description**

The function `claim()` in Airdrops.sol does not include a header to provide context of the proof (e.g. address(this), chain id, version) which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation**: 

Include the necessary context header in the `claim()` function to ensure security and prevent potential vulnerabilities. This can help in verifying the legitimacy of the claim and enhance the overall security of the smart contract.

**Client comment**: Not applicable, since airdrop is only happening on one chain and for airdrops of new phases new contracts will be deployed. This disclaimer is updated in the documents and comments were updated.

### Unused Return Value from `mint()` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Airdrops.sol

**Description**

In the `claim()` function of Airdrops.sol, the return value from the `mint()` function is not being used or captured for processing, potentially leading to unintended consequences or overlooked error handling.

**Recommendation**: 

ensure to capture and handle the return value from the `mint()` function appropriately, such as checking for success or failure status and reacting accordingly based on the result to maintain the integrity and correctness of the operation.

## Informational

### Commented-Out Code Results in Unnecessary Event Emission for Unchanged Whitelist Status

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `AdvancedOrderEngine` contract includes commented-out code that originally performed a check for unchanged access status of whitelisted tokens. This check was designed to revert the transaction with an `AccessStatusUnchanged()` error if the access status remained the same. However, the code is currently commented out, meaning this check is not executed. This might lead to confusion as the contract would emit an event even if there were no changes made.

**File**: AdvancedOrderEngine.sol

```solidity
162:     function updateTokenWhitelist(
163:         address[] calldata tokens,
164:         bool[] calldata access
165:     ) external onlyOwner {
..
187:             // // Revert if the access status remains unchanged.
188:             // if (isWhitelistedToken[tokens[i]] == access[i])
189:             //     revert AccessStatusUnchanged();
190:             // }
191: 
192:             isWhitelistedToken[tokens[i]] = access[i];
193: 
194:             emit WhitelistStatusUpdated(tokens[i], access[i]);
```



**Recommendation**:

Consider Uncommenting the code to avoid unchanged status being emitted again.



## Uninitialized `minimumFee` and Ability to Set `minimumFee` to Zero

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The `minimumFee` variable is not initialized in the constructor, which means it defaults to zero. Additionally, the `setMinimumFee()` function allows the `minimumFee` to be explicitly set to zero. This might be acceptable depending on the intended functionality of the contract, but it is important to confirm whether this behavior aligns with the desired protocol operations.

**Description**: AdvancedOrderEngine.sol

```solidity
262:     function setMinimumFee(
263:         uint _fee
264:     ) external onlyOwner {
265:         if(_fee > 2000) revert ExceedsTwentyPercent(); 
266:         // Local copy to save gas.
267:         uint256 currentMinFee = minimumFee;
268: 
269:         emit MinimumFeeChanged(currentMinFee, _fee);
270: 
271:         minimumFee = _fee;
272:     }
```


**Recommendation**: 

Review the intended design and functionality of the protocol to determine whether minimumFee being zero is acceptable.

**Client comment**: it was a design choice

### Floating Pragma and Outdated Solidity version

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `Airdrops.sol` and `ClaimLib.sol` smart contracts uses a floating pragma version (^0.8.13). Contracts should be deployed using the same compiler version and settings as were used during development and testing. Locking the pragma version helps ensure that contracts are not inadvertently deployed with a different compiler version. Using an outdated pragma version could introduce bugs that negatively affect the contract system, while newly released versions may have undiscovered security vulnerabilities.
Additionaly, There are known issues that affects 0.8.13, read more about the issues here.


**Recommendation**: Consider locking the pragma version to a specific, tested version to ensure consistent compilation and behavior of the smart contract.




### Public Function Could Be Marked External

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `claim()` function of the Airdrops.sol contract is marked as public but it could be marked as external instead. While both public and external functions can be called from outside the contract, marking a function as external is generally more gas-efficient when it is not intended to be called internally.

**File**: Airdrops.sol

```solidity

             38:     function claim(bytes32[] memory merkleProof, uint amount) public {
               ..
             51:     }
```

**Recommendation**: 

Consider changing the visibility of the claim function from public to external to optimize gas usage.


### Lack of input validation in `or()` and `and()` functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: Predicates.sol

**Description**

The functions `or()` and `and()` in the Predicates.sol contract do not validate the offsets input, which can lead to errors and reverts during execution. The code snippet provided shows that the previous and current variables derived from offsets need validation to ensure previous is less than current. This lack of input validation can result in ambiguous errors and difficulties in debugging.
```solidity
   uint256 previous;
    for (
        uint256 current;
        (current = uint32(offsets)) != 0;
        offsets >>= 32
    ) {
        (bool success, uint256 res) = staticcallForUint(
            address(this),
            data[previous:current]
        ...
```
**Recommendation**: 

Add input validation checks in the `or()` and `and()` functions to ensure that the offsets parameter is correctly formatted and that previous is always less than current. This can help prevent unexpected reverts and improve the robustness of the contract. Implementing proper input validations will enhance the readability, security, and reliability of the contract.

**Client comment**:  

Forked from CoW swap, will remain the same.



### POOL PAIR IS NOT CHECKED IF IT IS SUPPORTED

**Severity**: Informational	

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `getUsdPrice()` function in the `UsdOracle.sol` contract checks if a pair is supported before querying all pools for that pair. To check if a pair is supported a call to `oracle.isPairSupported` is executed. It is checked for the case of `_baseToken/usdt` and `_baseToken/weth` but not for the case of `weth/usdt`. The pair WETH/USDT will normally be supported, as it is one of the main pairs in most chains. However, if the protocol is deployed to a new chain, it could happen that the pair is not supported yet.

**Recommendation**:

Add a `oracle.isPairSupported(weth, usdt);` call and a `require(result, "PathToUsdtPoolNotAvailable");` for checking the returned value before executing the call for querying all weth/usdt pools `oracle.getAllPoolsForPair(weth, usdt);`


### `getUsdPrice` DOES NOT RETURN USD PRICE

**Severity**: Informational	

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The function `getUsdPrice()` in `UsdOracle.sol` contract return the amount of base token in terms of USDT. However, the name of the function and some dev comments like: `/// @notice converts token to usd amount` suggest that the function is returning the amount in USD instead of USDT. It is important to remark that USDT price may not correspond to USD. The function name `getUsdPrice()` can also confuse and can suggest that the return amount is the price of 1 USDT instead of the amount in USDT terms.

**Recommendation**:

Change the function name to `getPriceInUsdt` and adjust comments.


### CATCH ARRAY LENGTH

**Severity**: Informational	

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Storing the array length in a variable before the loop starts reduces the number of read operations, resulting in a saving of approximately 3 gas units per iteration. This practice can yield substantial gas savings, particularly in situations involving loops that iterate over large arrays.

Static.sol implements several ‘for loops’ that can save gas if `array.length` is catched before the `for loop`. In the StaticOracle contract, the `addNewFeeTier` function reads `_knownFeeTiers.length` at each iteration of the for loop.

**Recommendation**:

Catch array.length before the `for loop` to save gas.



### USE ++i INSTEAD OF i++

**Severity**: Informational	

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The post-increment operation, i++ , requires more gas compared to pre-increment (++i). Post-increment involves both incrementing the variable i and returning its initial value, which necessitates the use of a temporary variable. This additional step results in extra gas consumption, approximately 5 gas units per iteration

StaticOracle.sol implements several for loops that can save gas if i is pre incremented.

**Recommendation**:

Use `++i` instead of `i++` in for loops.
