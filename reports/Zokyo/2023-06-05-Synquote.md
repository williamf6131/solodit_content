# Findings

## Informational

### Use of interface preferred


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

Abstract contracts are used instead of interfaces that allow for more extendibility in lines 21(IMarginEngine margin_engine) and lines 29 (IHistoricalOracle historical_oracle) 

**Recommendations**: 

Rewrite these abstract contracts to be interfaces 


### Reorder Require Statements

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledge

**Description**: 

The require statement on line 188 and the require statement  on line 194 should be interchanged so as the simpler require statement is ran first so the contract fails with less gas as possible so it might not need to get to the more complex require statement 
Same for the require statement on line 245 and the require statement for line 252


**Recommendations**: 

Make  the switch as suggested

### A variable was assigned a value but not used or returned inside the function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

**Recommendations**:

Since this variable is not used Would be advisable to remove it entirely to save memory space and gas.

**Comment by client on this issue**: 

The instrument ID that isnâ€™t used was just emitted in an event.


### A variable was assigned a value but only used once

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

**Recommendations**:

To save memory and gas, the expression signature_signer == expected_signer can be moved into the require statement directly.
