## High Risk

### Double spending through Double Entry Point Tokens

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract SwapFacet, method _execute is vulnerable to a read-only reentrance through the convert flow ( opType == 2 ), if the same balance is read from the same tokens twice in the for loop the same delta will be calculated twice creating a double spending and allowing the attack to steal assets from the vault, normally this flow is not possible because the _sort functionality is taking care of eliminating the duplicates from the tokens list, however, this flow is not taking into consideration the Double Entry Point tokens ( see TUSD and SNX as some examples ).

**Scenario**:

Alice select opType = 2 here the opDest is her special contract.
 opAmount for DVT ( token name as example ) will be 0 for both addresses to just continue the operation and skip the transfer ( we took the most straight-forward case )
DVT balance for Vault is 100 tokens so in both iterations values 100 will be saved in balances array. 
External call to opDst happens, here Alice contract send 100 DVT tokens to Vault, so vault balance is now 200 DVT
In the next food loop where the delta is calculated ( difference between balanceAfter and balanceBefore ) will be 200 - 100 = 100 
In the first iteration 100 tokens are added to the cumDelta for the respective token, then in the second iteration because there was not transfer yet delta will be again 100 so value 100 will be added again in the cumDelta token for the second address ( which represents the same balances but Vault have no way to know that ) 
After that the settlement will happen as the last operation of the execute function and in the first iteration 100 tokens will be send ( the modified delta and basically the initial tokens that Alice send to the Vault through velocore_convert ) and in the second iteration again 100 tokens will be send of the same tokens through the different address and this will represent the profit for the attack 
Now attacker have 200 DVT and Vault 0 DVT. 

**Recommendation**: 

In the case of conversions do the tokens settlement in the loop iterations so that when balanceOf() will be called again (for the second iteration) the balance will be updated already.
Note #1: It is worth noticing that the pattern of double entry point tokens is not common in the EVM ecosystem and is not something that is usually implemented.

### Transfer design prone to DOS

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The Vault contract through execute function  is executing different user operations while tracking the user virtual balances and as a last step is setting the user balances by taking care of the tokens transfer, from user to vault or vice versa. There is a problem in this design because a user can carry, as an example, multiple swap operations and when the settlement will happen if one of those settlement will fail because it managed to by DOS by an external actor the user transaction will be reverted because 1 of maybe 20 transfers failed. 

**Recommendation**:

Do the settlement of tokens/virtual balances in try-catch blocks.
If one of the settlement transfer fails, reset the pool balance for that particular pool.



###  External call to transfer ETH might fail because of memory returned data

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Token library is used as a functionality wrapper to work with all different types of tokens that the protocol supports, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 and ETH ( or the native cryptocurrency of the EVM compatible chain ) . For the transfer of ETH ( native tokens ) the contract is doing a simple call to the destination address and after that is checking if the transfer have succeeded, Token.sol L#224. There is a problem with this approach, even if in the business logic you have do not use the returnedData field, that value will still be copied into memory and that can cause a DOS as it will revert with out of gas if the blob returned is to big.  

**Recommendation**: 

Do the low level call using assembly ( YUL ) as in that because it will completely ignore the returnedData.

## Medium Risk

### Unchecked delegatecall result

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Diamond.yul at line 30, inside the constructor, there is a delegatecall performed back to the caller contract (AdminFacet) which executes the initializeFacet. The result of the delegate call is not checked for success/failure.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check for the delegatecall result
 
 

### Initializers are missing lock mechanism

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contracts Ve and veVC are missing a lock mechanism for the initialize function. It is part of best practices and recommandations to lock all your initializers, the lock mechanism can be added either through the intializer modifier from openzeppelin or by adding a simple lock variable  that will be turned to true after the initializer will be first called and everytime somones wants to call the initialize function the first operation from the initialize function will be a check against the lock variable value. 

**Recommendation**: 

Add a lock mechanism for the initializers



### Allowance frontrunning results in double-spending

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract PoolWithLpToken is vulnerable to the ERC20 approve and double spend front-running attack. In this attack, a token owner authorizes another account to transfer a specific amount of tokens on their behalf, and in the case that the token owner decides to change that allowance amount, the spender could spend both allowances by front running the allowance-changing transaction. 

**Recommendation**: 

Add increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance functions to mitigate this attack

## Low Risk

### Diamond implementation does not follow standard

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


The current diamond implementation does not follow the standard as it has elements missing and some flows have been altered to produce  the same results in a different way than described in the standard. The purpose and rationale of writing the Diamond contract entirely in yul is understandable, but the gas/memory-ops savings don't offset the risks associated with the increased complexity. Besides the fact that elements are missing, such as LibDiamond, DiamondLoupeFacet, there's different ways to delegatecall the target implementation, which appears unnecessary.

**Recommendation**:

1. Rewrite the Diamond contract in solidity and only use yul for the fallback delegatecalls to implementations
2. Add the helper facets such as DiamondLoupe, DiamondCut and use a straightforward way of mapping implementation addresses to selectors (i.e LibDiamond)


### Incorrect assessment of delegatecall result

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract Diamond.yul at lines 49-50 and 80-81, after performing delegate calls, the execution result is checked in an incorrect way. It reverts if `success` i.e non-zero value, returning data for any other case. Throughout the contract there are other delegate calls performed, where the result of the execution is evaluated using a switch statemenet, where for the  result of `0` it reverts, returning for all other cases. This is the correct approach, as delegatecall returns 0 on error.

**Recommendation**: 

Change the result evaluation to the correct approach, as seen at lines 66-72




### Redundant logic for 'view' function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the Diamond.yul contract, there are different flows for calling a view and executing a function. Both perform a delegatecall to a target contract, the difference being that for the `view` flow, the destination address is read from calldata, in case the first 4 bytes of the calldata are equal to `view`. Also, if the `implementation` address is not valid for a function call, the contract creates the calldata needed for the `view` flow and performs a delegate call to self, with the new destination address being a bitwise_not of `implementation`. This is confusing and can lead to undefined behavior, as it relies on calldata and assumes a view call can be performed. The same applies for having separate flows for `view` and `normal` calls, as this can't really be enforced other than checking the calldata selector, which can be altered given it is user input. This contract should simply delegate calls to its different facets.

Recommendation:
1. Keep a single flow for delegatecalls, regardless whether it's a `view` or `normal` call
2. Remove the "fallback" to view calls if the implementation loaded from storage is not "valid". This adds complexity and confusion as it deviates from the contract's purpose

## Informational

### Add return statement

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


In the function spotPrice inside the contract VelcoreLens.sol,  there are multiple conditions that influence the parameters with which the function will be called recursively. However, if the function does not call itself, there is no return to be executed on this branch.

**Recommendation**: 

To follow the best practices, add a return statement at the end of the function.


### Transaction executed successfully in _execute parameter edge case.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract SwapFacet, function _execute logic choose the type of operation that will be performed based on the opType variable, the value for opType can be 0,1,2,3,4 each different integer represents a different operation ( swap, convert, stake, etc.. ). However if the opType value will be for example 5, the transaction will be executed successfully and the execute function will do nothing, in this case it will be recommend to fail early to not cost users to much gas, 

**Recommendation**: 

Fail the executio early by first checking the opType is between some boundaries and only after that check what that opType is, as an example if it is a value smaller then 5 simply revert the transaction.


### Debugging statements left in code

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the whole project there are multiple lines of code that invoke console.log functions that only have a role during the debugging phase, for production code, it will be recommended to remove them.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove all console.log function calls



### Require statements without error messages

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the whole project there are multiple require statements that do not have an error message associated with it, it would be recommended to have an error message associated with all the require statements.

**Recommendation**: 

Add error messages to all require statements.


### Vulnerable to phishing

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract AdminFacet is vulnerable to phishing as it is using tx.origin, we understand that is because of the forge deploy script however we will urge you to change the deployment mechanism and change the logic so it will not be depended of tx.origin anymore.

**Recommendation**: 

Change the logic dependency of tx.origin between AdminFacet and deployment mechanism.
