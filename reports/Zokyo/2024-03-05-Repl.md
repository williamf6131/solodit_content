# Findings

## Low Risk

###  Use of single step ownership transfer

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

The multiple contracts in the protocol use the `OwnableUpgradeable` contract which allows changing the owner address. However, this contract does not implement a 2-step-process for transferring ownership. If the adminâ€™s address is set incorrectly, this could potentially result in critical functionalities becoming locked.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider implementing a two-step pattern. Utilize OpenZeppelin's Ownable2StepUpgradeable contract.


### Lack of Return Value Validation in ERC20 Transfer

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: AgentImplementation.sol

**Description**

The smart contract initiates ERC20 token transfers without validating the return value of the transfer operation. Failing to check the return value may result in unhandled failures, exposing the contract to potential vulnerabilities and financial risks. The absence of return value validation may lead to unhandled transfer failures, causing unintended consequences in contract state and potentially resulting in financial losses.
This is taking place in 2 occurrences:
In function reclaimOwnerAddress -
```solidity
if (_pFILBalance > 0) {
    IPFIL(pFIL).transfer(owner, _pFILBalance);
}
```
Also in function paybackPFIL -
```solidity
IPFIL(pFIL).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _receive);
```
**Recommendation** - 

Validate Return Values: Implement validation checks on the return value of ERC20 token transfers to handle success or failure appropriately.

## Informational

### Redundant condition in withdrawal validation logic

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The condition within the if statement in the `agentWithdrawFromMiner` function contains redundancy. Specifically, the two conditions are attempting to ensure that after the withdrawal, there is still enough balance left to meet the reserved balance requirement.
```solidity
 if (_total < getReservedBalance() || _total < getReservedBalance() + amount) 
```
However, the second condition implicitly covers the first. If `_total` is less than `getReservedBalance() + amount`, it is inherently less than or equal to `getReservedBalance()` alone since amount is assumed to be a positive number. Therefore, the first condition (`_total < getReservedBalance()`) is unnecessary because if the second condition is true, the first is automatically true as well.

**Recommendation**:

Simplify conditional checks. Revise the conditional statement to eliminate redundancy, ensuring clarity and efficiency in logic. The recommended condition would be:
```solidity
if (_total < getReservedBalance() + amount)
```

 

### Potential Gas Inefficiency due to unneeded public accessibility

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: ReplAuction.sol, AgentImplementation.sol

**Description**

The smart contracts declare certain functions as public, even though they are not invoked from within the contract (i.e. internally). This could lead to potential gas inefficiency, as external function calls may offer more gas-efficient execution compared to public functions.
```solidity
// ReplAuction.sol
function getRemainingFILForAuction() public view returns (uint) 
function auctionIsExpired(address _agent) public view returns (bool) 

// AgentImplementation.sol
function calculateSafePledge() public onlyOwner 
```
**Recommendation** - 

To optimize gas usage and promote efficiency, it is recommended to adjust visibility levels by changing the visibility of functions that are not utilized internally to external, considering potential gas savings.
