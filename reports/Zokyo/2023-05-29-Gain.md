# Findings


## Low Risk

### Possibility of pre-distribution balance manipulation.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The  startDistribution function  in ERC20Distribution and  ERC20DistributionNative contracts is designed to begin the distribution of Gain Token to users. Function ensures that the amount of Gain Token held by the contract matches the total distribution balance before allowing to unpause and start the distribution process. If these two values do not match, the distribution process will not proceed. A malicious user who has come into possession of the Gain Token can send a small amount to the contract address before the distribution begins. As a result, the total distribution balance will no longer match the balance of the Gain Token held by the contract, causing the distribution to fail until excessive tokens will be taken out.  

The user with DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE can transfer those excessive tokens using purchaseTokens function which allows the admin to purchase distributed tokens even if the contract is paused, thus severity was reduced to low.

**Recommendation**: 

Change the require statement as follow:
```solidity
require(
       _trusted_token.balanceOf(address(this)) >=_total_distribution_balance,
       'Initial distribution balance must be correct'
       );
```
Make sure that only trusted actors can start a new distribution cycle.

**Fixed**: Issue fixed in commit 4886ba3

### Functions that do not expect to receive ether should be non-payable

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

A function that does not expect to receive ether should not be marked as payable. However, the startDistribution function in ERC20Distribution and ERC20DistributionNative contracts and purchaseTokens in ERC20Distribution are currently marked as payable. Given that the contract does not have the necessary functionality to handle received ether, then marking these functions as payable could result in funds being stuck in the contract if users accidentally send ether while calling these functions.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove payable keywords from the listed functions.

### Lack of protection against userâ€™s excessive ether loss

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The ERC20DistributionNative.purchaseTokens checks whether the transaction ether value is sufficient to purchase the required amount of Gain Token. If the transaction value is higher than the required amount, the excess ether will be sent to the contract. The user who accidentally sent more ether than required will lose those funds since they will not receive the corresponding amount of Gain Token in return. This could result in a loss of funds for the user and may lead to mistrust in the system.

**Recommendation**: 

Change the require statement as follow:

```solidity
     require(
       msg.value == fiattoken_amount,
       "PurchaseTokens: transaction value must be sufficient"
     );
```
**Fixed**: Issue fixed in commit 4886ba3

## Informational

### Use immutable on variables that are only set at construction

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Variables only set in the constructor and never edited afterward should be marked as immutable, as it would avoid the expensive storage-writing operation in the constructor.
```solidity
ERC20Distribution._fiat_token
ERC20Distribution._trusted_token, ERC20DistributionNative._trusted_token
_beneficiaryERC20Distribution._beneficiary, ERC20DistributionNative._beneficiary
ERC20Distribution._startrate_distribution, ERC20DistributionNative._startrate_distribution
ERC20Distribution._endrate_distribution, ERC20DistributionNative._endrate_distribution 
ERC20Distribution._divider_rate, ERC20DistributionNative._divider_rate
```

**Recommendation**: 

Make the listed variables immutable.

**Fixed**: Issue fixed in commit 4886ba3


### Uncalled public functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Public functions that are never called from within the contract should be marked as external.
```solidity
ERC20Distribution.user_fiattoken_balance
ERC20Distribution.fiattoken_contractbalance
ERC20Distribution.startrate_distribution
ERC20DistributionNative.startrate_distribution
ERC20Distribution.endrate_distribution
ERC20DistributionNative.endrate_distribution
ERC20Distribution.dividerrate_distribution
ERC20DistributionNative.dividerrate_distribution
ERC20Distribution.total_distribution_balance
ERC20DistributionNative.total_distribution_balance
ERC20Distribution.current_distributed_balance
ERC20DistributionNative.current_distributed_balance
ERC20Distribution.startDistribution
ERC20DistributionNative.startDistribution
ERC20Distribution.distributionStarted
ERC20DistributionNative.distributionStarted
ERC20Distribution.changeKYCApprover
ERC20DistributionNative.changeKYCApprover
ERC20Distribution.claimFiatToken
ERC20DistributionNative.claimFiatToken
ERC20Distribution.purchaseTokens
ERC20DistributionNative.purchaseTokens
```
**Fixed**: Issue fixed in commit 4886ba3

### Invalid data emitted by event

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The TokensSold event is emitted after the ERC20Distribution.purchaseTokens function succeeds. However, instead of emitting the event with valid amountToken value it gets msg.value.

**Recommendation**: 

Correct the tokenAmount value emitted in TokenSold event.

**Fixed**: Issue fixed in commit 4886ba3
