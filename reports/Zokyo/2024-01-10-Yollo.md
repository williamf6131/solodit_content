## High Risk


### Accounting discrepancy due to fee-on-transfer token

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The YolloToken contract extends the basic functionality of ERC20 with additional features, such as fee deduction on transfers, and implements the ERC1363 standard. To purchase a package, a user needs to transfer the staking token to the YolloStaking contract using the transferAndCall function. This function enhances the basic token transfer functionality of ERC20. It allows for the transfer of a chosen amount of tokens to a recipient, followed by a callback to the recipient's contract. This process triggers the onTransferReceived hook, executing any relevant logic. However, the overridden _update function deducts a fee from this amount, leading to the actual number of tokens received by the user being less than the specified amount. This results in an accounting discrepancy, where the contract records a higher number of tokens as staked than what the user has actually received post-fee deduction. Such an inconsistency can lead to the breaking of the contract's accounting logic.

**PoC**:
```solidity
      
   function test_onTransferReceivedConsiderTokenFeeWhenUpdatingStakingTokenTransfersForUsers()
       public
   {
       uint256 stakingContractBalanceBefore = yollloToken.balanceOf(
           address(staker)
       );
       vm.startPrank(user1);


       yollloToken.transferAndCall(address(staker), stakeAmount);


       uint256 stakingContractBalanceAfter = yollloToken.balanceOf(
           address(staker)
       );


       assertEq(
           staker.stakingTokenTransfers(user1),
           stakingContractBalanceAfter - stakingContractBalanceBefore
       );
   }
```

  




**Recommendation**: 

Adjust the `onTransferReceived` function to ensure that the recorded staked amount equals the actual amount received.

## Medium Risk

### Accrue package reward does not transfer enough tokens for rewards

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract `YollloStaking.sol`, the method `accruePackageReward(...)` allows the package manager role to accrue rewards for the user and transfer the rewards from the treasury wallet to the staking contract.

In this logic, fees on the transferred tokens for accrued rewards are not considered making the total amount sent to the contract less than the total rewards accumulated for the user.

Similarly, the method `releaseRewards(...)` will revert for some users as there won't be enough tokens to send to all the users as not enough rewards are sent.

**PoC**:
```solidity
function test_accruePackageRewardMonthlyShouldSendCorrectAmountOfTokensToStakingContract()
       public
   {
       stakingTokenTransferForPuchasingPackage();
       puchasingPackageWithStakingTokenTransfer();


       vm.startPrank(packageManager);


       uint256 stakingContractBalanceBefore = yollloToken.balanceOf(
           address(staker)
       );


       for (uint i = 0; i < annualAccrualCount; i++) {
           vm.warp(block.timestamp + (i + 1) * 30 days + 1);
           staker.accruePackageReward(user1, 1);
       }


       uint256 stakingContractBalanceAfter = yollloToken.balanceOf(
           address(staker)
       );


       assertEq(
           staker.getPackage(user1, 1).rewards,
           stakingContractBalanceAfter - stakingContractBalanceBefore
       );
       vm.stopPrank();
   }
```



**Recommendation**: 

Update the logic to consider the fees paid on transferring tokens to the staking contract, and transfer enough tokens for rewards.


## Low Risk

### Reminting burned tokens breaks the protocol’s assumption

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

The YolloToken contract inherits from ERC20Capped, setting its maximum supply limit to 1_000_000_000 * 1 ether. As it also derives from ERC20Burnable, when the burn function is called, it decreases the totalSupply. For example, if 100 tokens are initially minted and later 20 of these tokens are burned, the totalSupply is reduced to 80. If another 20 tokens are minted thereafter, the new totalSupply becomes 100 again. This situation poses a conflict with the protocol's initial assumption that the total supply of minted tokens should always be capped at 1_000_000_000 * 10 ** 18.

**Recommendation**: 


Remove the ERC20Burnable inheritance.

Acknowledged with the comment: It is more right to say that we want to have a fixed hard cap of the YollloToken supply. However it is desirable for us to have the feature of burning tokens.



### Use of single step ownership transfer

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The YolloToken contract uses the Ownable contract, which allows changing the owner address. If the admin’s address is set incorrectly, this could potentially result in critical functionalities becoming locked.

**Recommendation**:

Consider implementing a two-step pattern. Utilize OpenZeppelin's Ownable2Step contract.

### Tiers can be set with principal USD as 0 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract YollloStaking.sol, the method `setTier(...)` allows the admin to set a new Tier with principalUSD as 0. If such a tier is set, the method getTier() and getTiers() will not include those in the tiers list for the following reasons.
```solidity
if (_tiers[i].principalUSD > 0) {
               tiers[currentTierCount++] = _tiers[i];
           }
```
Also, purchasing a package for such a tier will fail with the following error.
```solidity
if (tier.principalUSD == 0) {
           revert TierNotFound(tierNumber);
       }
```
**PoC:**
```solidity
function test_RevertsWhenPuchasingPackageWithTierSetWithZeroPrincipalUSD()
       public
   {
       staker.setTier(2, 0, 100, 100);


       stakingTokenTransferForPuchasingPackage();
       vm.startPrank(packageManager);
       vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(TierNotFound.selector, 2));


       staker.purchasePackage(user1, 2, stakeAmount, true);
   }
```




**Recommendation**: 

Add a validation to ensure no tiers are set with principal USD as 0.


### Package’s `currentMPR` can be 0

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract YollloStaking.sol, the method `purchasePackage(...)` allows to purchase a package and sets the currentMPR for a package using the following formula:
```solidity
package.currentMPR = tier.passiveAPR / annualAccrualCount;
```
Here if tier.passiveAPR is less than 12 which is highly unlikely will set the currentMPR as 0 making users accrued rewards 0.

Similarly when a package is updated, currentMPR is updated using the following formula:
```solidity
       uint256 currentMPR = apr / annualAccrualCount;
```
Here also if apr is less than 12 then the currentMPR will be 0.

**PoC:**
```solidity
function test_CurrentMPR_is_Zero_WhenNewPackageIsPuchased() public {
       staker.setTier(2, 10000, 10, 10); // passiveAPR < 12
       stakingTokenTransferForPuchasingPackage();


       vm.startPrank(packageManager);
       staker.purchasePackage(user1, 2, stakeAmount, true);


       uint256 currentMPR = staker.getPackage(user1, 2).currentMPR;
       assertEq(currentMPR, 0);
       vm.stopPrank();
   }
```


=


**Recommendation**: 

Add checks to ensure that the currentMPR is never set to 0.

**Fix**: Apply the same fix when updating the packages’ apr in updatePackage(...) method



### No validation for `vestingDuration`

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract `YolloVestingManager.sol`, the method `createVestingWallet(...)` allows a wallet manager to create a new wallet but does not validate the vesting duration. The vesting duration can be set very high value and it will make it impossible for a user to get the vested tokens.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check to maintain the vesting duration within a maximum limit.

### Principal USD not utilized

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract YollloStaking.sol, the method setTier(...) sets a tier with principal USD but principalUSD value is not used anywhere when purchasing/accruing/releasing the package.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the logic to use the value principalUSD if needed.

This is to be used for backend as per client comment.



## Informational

### Modifier whenNotPaused not needed in `overridden _update` method

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract YollloToken.sol, the method _update(...) uses the modifier `whenNotPaused` which is not needed as the ERC20Pausable contract has already added this modifier for the _update(...) method.

**PoC**:
```solidity
function test_RevertTokenTransferWhenPaused() public {
       yollloToken.pause();


       address user2 = makeAddr("user2");
       vm.startPrank(user1);
       vm.expectRevert(EnforcedPause.selector);
       yollloToken.transfer(user2, 10000000);
   }
```



**Recommendation**:

Modifier `whenNotPaused` can be removed.




### Floating pragma

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Audited contracts use the following floating pragma:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
```
It allows to compile contracts with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.

### Incorrect comment

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract YollloVestingWallet.sol, the method `vestedAmount(...)` comment is incorrect.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the comment
