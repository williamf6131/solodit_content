# Findings

## High Risk

### Denial of Service via Unbounded Loops

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The massUpdateRewards function in SingleLiquidityProvider.sol retrieves an array (pools[stable].investmentIds) containing all investment IDs associated with a given pool. This function loops through all elements of this array. If the array pools[stable].investmentIds grows significantly large, this function could potentially consume excessive gas, reaching the block gas limit and leading to a denial of service (DoS). This would prevent users from updating rewards if the array becomes too large, affecting contract functionality. The same issue is also present in the removeIdFromList function.

**Recommendation**: 

To mitigate the risk of a DoS due to an unbounded loop, consider limiting the number of Ids so that it is impossible that you surpass the block gas limit. Or, change the logic so that you're not forced to loop over all the existing Ids.

**Comment**: 

The mentioned functions has been removed from the contract.

## Medium Risk

### Deprecated or compromised pools can’t be removed

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The addNewPool function in SingleLiquidityProvider.sol allows the contract owner to add new pools by specifying a stable address and a vault. However, there is no corresponding function to remove a pool once it has been added. This limitation could present several issues:
Irreversible Configuration: Without the ability to remove pools, there is no way to handle cases where a pool needs to be deprecated, replaced, or removed due to changes in requirements or potential security concerns with the underlying stable or vault.
Increased Storage Costs: Over time, pools that are no longer in use will continue to occupy storage, unnecessarily increasing gas costs for interactions that depend on the total number of pools or those that iterate over validStables.
Potential for Unwanted Interactions: If a stable or vault associated with a pool becomes compromised or deprecated, users may still interact with it accidentally, potentially putting their assets at risk.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a removePool function to enable the contract owner to deactivate or remove pools. This function should update the validStables mapping and emit an event for transparency.

**Client Comment**: in order to optimization and simplify the logic, contract has only one token as an one pool.

### Potential Precision Loss Due to Division Before Multiplication 

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The calculateEmissionPerSecond function in SingleLiquidityProvider.sol performs division before multiplication in the line ((apy / 100) * investmentAmount) / timePeriod, which may lead to precision loss. When working with integer division, dividing apy by 100 first can round the result down if apy is not a multiple of 100. This can cause an incorrect and lower emission value, especially with low apy values.
In cases with small apy values or when precision is critical, this approach could result in miscalculations affecting user rewards or emissions.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider revisiting the calculations in the contract and change the operation orders to multiply before dividing to minimize rounding errors.


### Risk of Centralisation

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

The current implementation grants significant control to the owner through multiple functions that can alter the contract's state and behavior. This centralization places considerable trust in a single entity, increasing the risk of potential misuse.
If the owner's private key is compromised, an attacker could execute any function accessible to the owner, potentially leading to fund loss, contract manipulation, or service disruption.

**Recommendation**: 

To enhance security and reduce the risk of a single point of failure, it is recommended to implement a multi-signature wallet for executing owner functions. 



### Improper Use of approve Instead of safeApprove from SafeERC20

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contract directly calls the approve function of ERC20 tokens without using the safeApprove method provided by SafeERC20. This can be unsafe with tokens that do not fully conform to the ERC20 standard or have non-standard behaviors.
addLiquidityToPool(address stable, uint256 amount, address receiver)
Direct Use of approve: The contract uses IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount); instead of IERC20(token).safeApprove(spender, amount);.
Risk with Non-Standard Tokens: Some tokens (e.g., USDT) do not return a boolean value from approve, causing standard approve calls to fail or behave unexpectedly.

**Scenario**

In the addLiquidityToPool function:
```solidity
function addLiquidityToPool(address stable, uint256 amount, address receiver) private {
    IDebtToken(debtToken).mintFromWhitelistedContract(amount);
    address vault = pools[stable].vault;
    IERC20(stable).approve(vault, amount); // Direct approve
    IERC20(debtToken).approve(vault, amount); // Direct approve
    IArrakisV2(vault).mint(amount, receiver);
}
```
If stable or debtToken is a token like USDT, the approve call may not work as expected.
This can lead to failed transactions or vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation**

Use safeApprove from SafeERC20 Instead of Direct approve Calls
Replace approve with safeApprove: Utilize the safeApprove method to handle tokens with non-standard behaviors.

**Comment**: 

The contract now uses safeIncreaseAllowance.

## Low Risk

### Misleading Function Naming for suspendDeposit Toggle Mechanism

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The suspendDeposit function in SingleLiquidityProvider.sol is named in a way that implies it only suspends deposits, while it actually toggles the deposit status between active and suspended. An administrator may mistakenly assume that calling the function once will permanently suspend deposits and could unintentionally reactivate deposits by calling it again.

**Recommendation**: 

To avoid confusion, either rename the function to better reflect its toggle nature or split it into two distinct functions, suspendDeposit and resumeDeposit. This will provide clearer intent and usage.

**Comment**: 

the name has been changed to switchDepositStatus.


### Lack of Two-Step Ownership Transfer 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contracts does not implement a two-step process for transferring ownership. In its current state, ownership can be transferred in a single step, which can be risky as it could lead to accidental or malicious transfers of ownership without proper verification.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a two-step process for ownership transfer where the new owner must explicitly accept the ownership. It is advisable to use OpenZeppelin’s Ownable2Step.



### The owner can renounce ownership

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

The Ownable contracts includes a function named renounceOwnership() which can be used to remove the ownership of the contract. 
If this function is called on the SingleLiquidityProvider contract, it will result in the contract becoming disowned. This would subsequently break functions of the token that rely on onlyOwner modifier.


 **Recommendation**: 
 
 override the function to disable its functionality, ensuring the contract cannot be disowned e.g.

### Inadequate Pool Validity Check in suspendDeposit Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

The suspendDeposit function allows anyone with ownership control to suspend deposits for a non-existent pool, as there is no check to verify if the given stablecoin address (stable) is valid. This could lead to unexpected behavior or unintentional suspension.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a validation to check if pools[stable] is valid before changing the suspension status
```solidity
 if (!validStables[stable]) revert PoolDoesNotExist();
```
### Missing Validation of Enum Parameter months

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contract accepts a months parameter of type MONTHS (an enum) in several functions without validating that the value is within the valid range. Enums in Solidity are represented as uint8, and users can pass invalid values outside the defined enum range.

**Scenario**

A user calls the deposit function with an invalid months value:
singleLiquidityProvider.deposit(stableAddress, amount, MONTHS(255), true);
The MONTHS enum only defines values for SIX, TWELVE, and EIGHTEEN.
Passing MONTHS(255) could cause calculateLockedPeriod to default to unexpected behaviour.

**Recommendation**:

Validate months Parameter to Ensure It's Within Defined Enum Values
Create a function to check if months is a valid enum value.Reject any months value outside the defined enum range.

**Comment**: 

the MONTHS parameter is not supplied by the user anymore.

## Informational

### Lack of Zero Address Validation in Critical Functions

**Severity**: Informational 

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Functions like addNewPool do not validate that critical addresses (e.g., vault) are not zero addresses. Using a zero address can lead to interactions with non-contract addresses, causing transactions to fail or behave unexpectedly.
```solidity
function addNewPool(address stable, address vault) external onlyOwner {
    if (validStables[stable]) revert StableAlreadyAdded();
    validStables[stable] = true;
    pools[stable].vault = vault; // No check if vault is address(0)
    emit NewPoolAdded(stable, vault);
}
```
Risk of Invalid Addresses: Setting vault to address(0) can lead to failed interactions when the contract attempts to call functions on the vault.

**Scenario**

The owner mistakenly adds a new pool with vault as address(0):
Subsequent calls to addLiquidityToPool or removeLiquidityFromPool will fail when attempting to interact with address(0).
Users will experience failed transactions, and funds may become locked.

**Recommendation**:

Ensure that critical addresses are not zero addresses before assigning them.
