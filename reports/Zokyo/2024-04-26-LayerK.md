# Findings

## Information Risk

### _addr array can be empty

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

In Contract LayerK.sol, the method `addNRemoveWhiteList(...)` has a param `_addr` which can be empty.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the check to ensure that `_addr` length is more than 0 as well.

### The burn amount can be 0

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

In Contract LayerK.sol, the method `burn(...)` has a param `value` which can be 0.

**Recommendation**: 

Add the check to ensure that the `value` is not 0.


### Override decimals method in LayerK contract

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

In Contact LayerK.sol, an ERC20 implementation, no decimals method is overridden to update the decimals value from 18 to 8. 

**Recommendation**:

It is recommended to override the `decimals()` method in the LayerK contract instead of directly updating the imported OpenZeppelinâ€™s ERC20 contract.

### Minted tokens will always be sent to the Owner

Severity: Informational

Status: Unresolved

**Description**

In Contract LayerK.sol, mint is allowed to be called by the owner, minted tokens will always be sent to the owner only because of the following logic:
```solidity
_mint(msg.sender, _amount); => as owner == msg.sender
```
this increases the gas cost 2X if these tokens were supposed to be transferred to any particular address.

**Recommendation**: 

It will be advised to send the tokens to an address passed in the parameter.
