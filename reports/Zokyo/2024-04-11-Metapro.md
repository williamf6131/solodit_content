# Findings

## High Risk

### Burn method allows anyone to burn anyones’ tokens

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract MPRO.sol and MPROLight.sol, the `burn` method has the following logic:
```solidity
function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external virtual {
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
```
Here, any malicious user can pass any other users address and all their token balance and burn it all leading to loss of funds for users and the protocol.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the `burn()` method to burn only `msg.senders`’ tokens.

### Inaccurate Token Deduction and Burn Mechanism in transferFrom Function

**Severity**: High

**Location**: MPRO line 296

**Status**: Resolved


**Issue Summary**:

The current implementation of the `transferFrom` function in the smart contract incorrectly calculates the amount of tokens burned and transferred, leading to potential fund loss for the token approver. This occurs due to the burn mechanism being applied after the token transfer approval but before the actual token transfer, affecting the total amount deducted from the approver's balance.

**Detailed Explanation**:

In the provided contract logic, when a user (User A) approves another user (User B) to transfer a specific amount of tokens (e.g., 1 million tokens) on their behalf, and User B initiates a `transferFrom` operation with a burn-on-transfer fee, the actual amount transferred plus the burned amount exceeds the approved amount. This results in an incorrect total deduction from User A's account.
The function `_burnOnTransfer` calculates a burn amount based on the transfer amount and subtracts this from the total amount to be transferred. However, if User B transfers an amount such that the sum of the transferred amount and the burn amount exceeds User A's approved amount, User A incurs an unintended loss of funds beyond their approval.

**Impact**:

This behavior leads to a higher deduction from the approver's account than approved, causing potential fund losses and undermining the trust in the contract's token transfer and burn mechanisms.

**Recommendation**:

To rectify this issue, we recommend adjusting the `transferFrom` and `_burnOnTransfer` functions to ensure that the burn amount is considered within the total approved amount, not in addition to it. This adjustment should enforce that the total amount deducted from the approver's balance (including any burned tokens) does not exceed the initially approved amount.

A potential solution involves revising the logic to:
- Calculate the burn amount upfront.
- Ensure the sum of the amount to be transferred and the burn amount does not exceed the approved amount.
- Deduct the burn amount from the transfer amount before calling _transferFrom.

## Medium Risk

### ETH Cannot Be Withdrawn From The Vesting Contract

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

There’s a `receive()` function in the `MPROVesting.sol` and it is mentioned that the contract should be able to receive ether (for reasons not mentioned) , but this ether cannot be withdrawn since there is no withdraw functionality for ether . Therefore any ether sent to this contract would be stuck inside the contract.

Recommendation:

Either have a withdrawal functionality or remove the `receive()` function if not needed.


### DoS for distribute and `distributeBulk` method

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract `MPROMasterDistributor.sol`, the method `getAllTokenDistribution()` calculates the tokens so far available to distribute. In this method, if a reduction is added and a user calls it before the `reductionTimestamp`, the transaction revers due to underflow issue as `index–` in the for loop will try to `0 - 1`.

Since this method `getAllTokenDistribution()` is called by both `distribute()` and `distributeBulk()` methods, these methods will revert as well.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the logic to avoid this scenario by updating the for loop.

## Low Risk

### Beneficiary Might Lose Existing Claimable Reward If Registered Again

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

A beneficiary can be registered through the `registerBeneficiaries()` function in `MPROVesting.sol` , if the beneficiary already had an amount then this code is executed 

```solidity
if (beneficiary.amount > 0) {
                if (beneficiary.claimed > _amounts[i]) {
                    beneficiary.amount = beneficiary.claimed;
                } else {
                    beneficiary.amount = _amounts[i];
                }
```
This means that if the beneficiary already had an amount and a new amount is being assigned then he would lose the previous claimable amount . 

**Recommendation**:

Make sure the beneficiary can not be updated unless he has claimed his remaining rewards.


## Informational

### Introduce Sanity Checks

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

There should be sanity checks performed while assigning values to the `tgeUnlockPercent` and `vestingUnlockPercentPerPeriod` in `MPROVesting.sol` since these values should not go beyond 10000.

**Recommendation**:

While assigning these values in the constructor make sure they are less than 10000.

### Inefficient Looping Over Dynamic Array

**Severity**: Informational

**Status** - Resolved

**Location**: MPROVesting line 179, MPROMasterDistributor line 222, 376, 502, MPRO line 91

**Summary**: 

Iterating over a dynamic array using its length property in each loop iteration may lead to excessive gas consumption.
**Description**: 

When looping through an array with for (uint256 i = 0; i < _beneficiaries.length; i++), the .length property is read from storage on every iteration. In Solidity, storage reads are costly in terms of gas usage. This pattern can significantly increase the transaction cost, especially with larger arrays.

**Recommendation**:

Cache the array length in a local variable before the loop starts, and use this variable for comparison in the loop condition. This reduces the number of storage reads to just one, lowering the overall gas cost of the transaction.

### Unnecessary Initialization of Variables to Zero in Solidity

**Severity**: Informational 

**Status** - Resolved

**Location**: MPROMasterDistributor Line 133

**Summary**: 

In Solidity, variables are initialized to their default values automatically, with uint256 types defaulting to 0. Explicit initialization to 0 is redundant and can be omitted for brevity and clarity.

**Context**: The distributedTokens variable is explicitly initialized to 0, which is unnecessary as Solidity automatically initializes uint256 variables to 0.

**Recommendation**: Simplify the declaration by omitting the explicit initialization:
```
uint256 private distributedTokens;
```
Removing the explicit initialization makes the code cleaner and emphasizes the use of Solidity's default initialization behavior, without any impact on functionality or gas costs.
