# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Missing sanity checks and division by Zero Error

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract CORGI, there are missing sanity checks for `txFee`, `burnFee` and `FeeAddress`.
The `txFee` and `burnFee` can be arbitrarily set to any value, including value above 100. The same sanity checks are also missing in the `updateFee()` function. 
```solidity
        txFee = _txFee;
        burnFee = _burnFee;
        FeeAddress = _FeeAddress;
```
If any of `txFee` or `burnFee` is set to a value greater than 100, then it can lead to division by Zero Safemath error.
```solidity
Line: 421              uint256 DenverDeflaionaryDecay = tempValue.div(uint256(100 / txFee));
Line: 428              uint256 Burnvalue = tempValue.div(uint256(100 / burnFee));
```
Additionally, there is missing zero address check for `FeeAddress`.

**Recommendation: Add a sanity checks as follows**:

Add sanity checks to ensure that txFee & burnFee cannot be greater than 100 in both the constructor` and the `updateFee()` function.
Add a non-zero address check for `FeeAddress` in the constructor.


### Centralization issue

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged 

**Description**

In contract CORGI, the `txFee` & `burnFee` can be set to a value that is arbitrarily very high. This can be done anytime by a malicious owner or compromised admin of the contract. 
This can lead to changing of transfer & burn fees without userâ€™s notice or consent and can lead to users losing most of their tokens during transfer.

**Recommendation**:

It is advised to:
Add a MAX fee value for `txFee` and burnFee in BOTH the constructor and the `updateFee` function. Ideally the `MaxFee` should be less than 50% of the tokens being transferred.
It is advised to use a multisig wallet for the owner of the contract with configuration of at least 2/3 or 3/5 owners to mitigate accidental loss of private keys. And ensure sufficient decentralization.

## Low Risk
### Fee is charged on tokens even during Self-transfer

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

There is a transaction and `burnFee` that CORGI token levies when transferring the tokens (when the sender is not `FeeAddress`). 
But when a user self transfers tokens i.e. transfers the tokens to himself, the transaction fees is still levied. 
This might not be ideal as the transfer fees should only be levied when user transfers tokens to other addresses. This deviates from the behaviour of an ideal ERC20 token.
The following is the ERC20 Property failing of the CORGI tokens on self transfer of tokens:


**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to not levy any fees when self transferring of CORGI tokens.
