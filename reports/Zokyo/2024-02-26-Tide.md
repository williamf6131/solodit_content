# Findings

## High Risk


### Reentrance vulnerability allowing unlimited badges minting

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The claim function is intended to manage the process of claiming rewards by users. It performs several checks to ensure that the rewards have not already been claimed, that the claim is being made before a specified deadline, and if required, that the signature is verified. Upon passing these checks, it proceeds to mint badges for the user through the _mintBadge function.

The _mintBadge function internally calls _safeMint, which is responsible for the actual minting of the badge and setting the claim status for the user to prevent duplicate claims. The _safeMint includes a safety check to ensure the recipient is capable of receiving ERC721 tokens by implementing the IERC721Receiver interface. This is verified by calling _checkOnERC721Received, which invokes the onERC721Received method on the recipient contract and checks for the expected return value.
```solidity
   function _mintBadge(address user) internal {
       _safeMint(user, ++lastId);
       _claimed[user] = true;
       emit Claimed(user, lastId);
   }
```
After the initial external call in _safeMint to onERC721Received, the state variable _claimed[user] is set to true. This sequence allows for the possibility of a reentrance attack. An attacker can recursively call back into the claim function to mint an arbitrary number of badges before the _claimed[user] state is set to true.


**Recommendation**: 

It is recommended to employ the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. State changes such as setting _claimed[user] = true should be performed before making external calls, such as the call to the _safeMint.




### Denial of service via front-run gas limit manipulation 

**Severity**: High

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The execute function of the Forwarder contract is designed to forward transactions on behalf of users, allowing for operations such as token transfers or contract interactions. However, it does not properly validate or enforce minimum gas requirements for these forwarded transactions.

The function allows for external calls with user-specified gas limits. An attacker can observe a pending transaction and submit a similar transaction with a significantly lower gas limit and a higher gas price. Due to the higher gas price, the attacker's transaction is likely to be processed first, but it fails due to the low gas limit, thereby consuming the nonce but not completing the intended action. This failure not only wastes the gas but also prevents the original, legitimately intended transaction from being executed due to the nonce mismatch. Although this does not permanently block transactions from being processed, it introduces unnecessary delays and complications for users, effectively denying service.

**Recommendation**: 

It is recommended to implement a gas validation check within the execute function. This check should ensure that the gas provided to the forwarded transaction is sufficient to cover its execution, including a buffer for any ETH transfers that might be part of the transaction.
```solidity
       uint gasForTransfer = 0;
       if (req.value != 0) {
           gasForTransfer = 40000; // Buffer for ETH transfers
       }
       require(gasleft() * 63 / 64 >= req.gas + gasForTransfer, "Insufficient gas");
```







### Lack of domain separator validation allows for replay attacks on different chains

**Severity**: High

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The execute function in Forwarder contract is designed to process requests by verifying the authenticity of signatures using the `_verifySig` function. This verification involves constructing a digest from various components, including a domain separator, request data, requestTypeHash, and suffixData. The domain separator typically includes a chain ID to ensure that a signature is only valid for a specific blockchain. 
However, the contract does not check the chain ID from the domain separator against the contract's current chain ID. That means that a valid signature on one blockchain could potentially be replayed on another blockchain. Attackers could exploit this by replaying transactions (signed requests) across different blockchains, where the same contract logic and state are deployed but the actual chain ID differs.


**Recommendation**: 

Modify the `_verifySig` function to include a validation step that checks the chain ID embedded within the domain separator against the contract's current chain ID. This ensures signatures cannot be replayed on different chains.

### Loss of funds due to the method `setTokenRewards`

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract WaveContract.sol, the method `setTokenRewards()` allows setting the new tokens rewards along with a new reward token address.

Once the new reward token is set, there is no way to withdraw old token rewards that were already funded.

This will lead to the loss of funds for the owner.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the method `setTokenRewards()` to send the old reward token back to the owner and funds with the new token rewards. Also, it is advised not to update the reward token when the contract is active.

## Medium Risk

### Lack of deadline check in forwarded request

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

Without a deadline parameter, each ForwardRequest is potentially valid indefinitely. This means that once a request is signed, it can be executed at any point in the future, provided that the nonce has not yet been used. If a request remains valid forever without a deadline, allowing it to be executed much later than the signer might have intended. This can lead to situations where the execution context (e.g., market conditions, contract states) has drastically changed from when the request was originally signed. Signers have no mechanism to limit the time window during which their request is valid, reducing their control over their own transactions.

**Recommendation**: 

Adjust the `ForwardRequest` struct to include a deadline parameter. Consider implementing logic within the contract's execution function to check the current block timestamp against the request's deadline, rejecting any requests that are past their expiration.



### Signature replay in multi-wave reward claims

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**:  Resolved

The claim function from WaveContract allows users to claim rewards based on specific conditions, such as time constraints (before a deadline) and signature verification. The signature, comprising parameters v, r, and s, serves as proof that the claim request is legitimate and authorized by a backend verifier.
When the protocol executes multiple reward waves concurrently without incorporating wave-specific identifiers in the signature verification process. The signatures are validated against a deadline and the claimant's address but do not account for the distinct context of each reward wave.
Without unique identifiers for each wave (such as a wave ID or the contract's address to tie the claim to a specific contract state or wave), the same signature could be valid for claims across multiple waves, assuming they share the same deadline.


**Recommendation**: 

Include a unique identifier in the data used to generate the signature. Specifically, incorporating address(this) (the address of the contract itself) as part of the signed data would tie each signature explicitly to a particular contract instance


### Method `setEndTimestamp` can be used to extend the deadline to take rewards infinitely

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract WaveContract.sol, the method `setEndTimestamp` allows the owner to update the end timestamp when users have minted the badges and the wave is about to end, which will lead to no rewards for users as onlyEnded will be invalid due to extended end timestamp.


This state will invalidate the requirement that users can be winners if they have minted badges and win rewards.


**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to set a duration for the wave contracts such that endTimeStamp can not be extended infinitely.


### Reentrance is possible if tokens with hooks (ERC777, etc.) are used

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract WaveContract.sol, the method executeRuffle(...) sends rewards to the winner but if the reward token is ERC77& or any token with hooks, the winner can reenter the executeRuffle() method to win the rewards again and again. 

**Recommend**: 

It is advised to use OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard’s nonReentrant() modifier here.



### Centralization risk due to keeper

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract WaveFactory.sol, the address keeper seems to authorize and configure all of the deployed wave contracts. In case this address is an EOA, this will lead to centralization risk for all the deployed wave contracts.

**Recommendation**:  

Use a multi-sig wallet for the contract and the roles, to increase decentralization and minimize the risk of malicious admin or loss of private keys. 

### Centralization risk as the owner can disqualify all minted token Ids

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the protocol, there can be a state where the owner can disqualify all token IDs for the reward and then withdraw all the reward tokens once the wave has ended.

This state will invalidate the requirement that users can be winners if they have minted badges and win rewards.

**Recommendation**: 

update the logic to not allow admin to disqualify all tokenIds. Also, use multi-sig account for the owner.

## Low Risk

### Use of single step ownership transfer

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Resolved

**Description**

The WaveFactory, WaveContract and RaffleManager contracts use the Ownable contract which allows changing the owner address. However, this contract does not implement a 2-step-process for transferring ownership. If the admin’s address is set incorrectly, this could potentially result in critical functionalities becoming locked.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider implementing a two-step pattern. Utilize OpenZeppelin's Ownable2Step contract.

### DoS attack is possible if the token transfer fails for any one user

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract WaveContract.sol, the method executeRuffle(...) sends rewards to all the winners in one go. 

If any of the winner addresses are unable to receive the token rewards due to being blacklisted (e.g. USDT), then the transfer of rewards to all users will be reverted. This will also be possible if any user sends it’s NFT token to one or more blacklisted addresses.

This will lead to a DoS attack for all valid users as well.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a method to allow the winner to withdraw rewards.



### Unhandled return values of  transfer/transferFrom 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract WaveContract.sol, the method executeRaffle(...) uses `transfer` method to send tokens to the winner. Similarly, _initiateRewards i WaveFactory. Since a reward token can be any token, there is a possibility of the following issue.

ERC20 implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of transfer and transferFrom could return ‘false’ on failure instead of reverting. It is safer to wrap such calls into require() statements to these failures.

**Recommendation**: 

Use OpenZeppelin’s safeERC20 wrapper




### The `randomNumber` received is not validated for 0

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract WaveContract.sol, the method fulfillRaffle(...) does not validate if _randomNumber is 0 or not.

If it is set as 0, then executeRaffl() will not execute.

**Recommendation**: 

Add the validation to check if `_randomNumber` is 0 or not and revert with a proper error message.

## Informational

### Need validation in Wave contract constructor

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract WaveContract.sol, the constructor only checks if the token is address(0) but doesn’t revert. In case It is address(0), it can lead to the claim(...) transaction being reverted if it’s an erc20 claim rewards type.

Similarly, the start timestamp can be less than the current block.timestamp.

**Recommendation**: 

Add the necessary validation.


### Use specific Solidity compiler version

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Few of the audited contracts use the following floating pragma:
pragma solidity ^0.8.21;

It allows compiling contracts with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.

### Natspec comment/Typo

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract RaffleManager.sol l#34, natspec comment is missing for parameters,

**Recommendation**: 

Add the natspec comment.



### Unused struct

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

IWaveContract.sol has a struct TokenReward which is unused but inherited.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the unused struct.
