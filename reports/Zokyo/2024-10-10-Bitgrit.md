## Low Risk

### Usage of Floating Pragmas May Compile Contracts With an Unexpected Version

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The BitGrit (BGR) token contract uses the pragma ^0.8.20. By enabling the use of multiple compilers for this contract, they can lead to unexpected issues in the Solidity contracts as the code may have been tested with a different compiler than the one that is being used to deploy the contracts.

**Recommendation**: 

Itâ€™s recommended that the contract pins the pragma version which is used when testing the code.
