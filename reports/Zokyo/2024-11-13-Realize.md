# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Unchecked Return Value of transferFrom in requestRedemption

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The transferFrom function on Hub.sol is called to transfer tokens from the user to the operatorBurner address. However, this functionâ€™s return value is not checked to confirm that the transfer was successful and since the function returns a boolean, the return value must be checked.

**Recommendation:**

Check the return value of transferFrom to ensure the transfer was successful.

## Informational

### Unused variable

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Token.sol

**Description**

The contract declares the destinationEIds variable but the variable is not used in the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the unused variable.


### There is no reason for mint(), burn(), and burnFrom() functions to be payable - can lead to fund loss

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Token.sol

**Description**

In the current implementation, the mint(), burn(), and burnFrom() functions are payable, which means that users can send ETH along with the transaction call, however the functions has no operations to do with ETH, meaning that if a user accidentally sends ETH along with their function call, the ETH will be trapped in the contract which leads to fund loss for the user.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove payable keyword.

### Use of abi.encodeWithSignature Instead of abi.encodeCall

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The transferTokenOwnership and acceptOwnershipOfToken functions in Hub.sol use abi.encodeWithSignature to encode function calls. While this is a valid encoding approach, it is less type-safe than abi.encodeCall, which allows for compile-time type checking of function signatures. By using abi.encodeCall, any mismatch in argument types or numbers would trigger a compile-time error, improving the safety and reliability of function calls.

**Recommendation**:

Replace abi.encodeWithSignature with abi.encodeCall for improved type safety
