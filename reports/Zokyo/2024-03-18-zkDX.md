# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Non-concurrent buying and selling in Vault can lead to loss of funds

**Severity** : Medium

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description** :

If the user deposits tokens to the contract directly and calls `buyZKUSD()` function, then this function can be frontrunned by users and attackers before other users, resulting in zkusd being minted to the attacker. This is because the `_transferIn()` function on line: 61 assumes that the user has already transferred the underlying token to the vault in the previous transaction, and `_transferIn()` just calculates the difference in the balances of Vault in terms of the token. For example, Alice deposits 100 RETH tokens to the contract. Now when Alice sends a transaction to call the `buyZKUSD()` function after sending tokens to the Vault, Eve frontruns her transaction leading to the ZKUSD tokens to Eve instead of Alice. 

This could also result in loss of funds for the first user, if two users simultaneaously transfer their funds, but the second user calls `buyUSD()` instead of the first. Leading to all ZKUSD being minted to the second user.

Similar issue exists for `sellZKUSD()` function of the Vault as `_transferIn()` is used again for this function on line: 88.

Another attack scenario which exists here is when two users say Alice and Bob transer 10 ZKUSD and 1000 ZKUSD respectively to the Vault. Now if Alice calls the `sellZKUSD()` function before Bob, it is possible for her to sell Bob's ZKUSD and burn them too! Thus Alice would get the underlying tokens by burning ZKUSD resulting her getting the underlying tokens too which were actually meant for Bob to redeem.
This issue also exists in `swap()` as it is `_transferIn()` is being called in `swap()` too on line: 119.

Although this vulnerability is mitigated by higher-level contracts such as Router.sol, which performs token transfers and vault actions atomically, direct interactions with the Vault.sol contract by users bypassing these safeguards could still be susceptible.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to use a `safetransferFrom()` so that users transfer the tokens to the contract in the same transaction as the `buyZKUSD()` (and `_transferIn`) to avoid the above attack scenarios. 

**Comments**: The client has used a stricter `onlyManager` modifier that allows only accounts with manager role to call this function. This does reduce the risk. But again the modifier acts as a whitelist due to usage of `isManager` mapping which does that erase the risk fully.

### Inadequate Validation in `clearTokenConfig`

**Severity** : Medium

**Status** : Resolved

**Description** : 

This function allows the removal of a token's configuration without ensuring there are no active or pending operations involving the token. If the token is in use (e.g., in open positions or liquidity pools), removing its configuration could lead to operations that are unable to be completed successfully, potentially resulting in locked funds or incorrect system behavior.

**Recommendation** : 

Before allowing a token's configuration to be cleared, implement checks to ensure that the token is not currently being used in any active operations. Additionally, consider providing a grace period during which users can close positions or withdraw funds.

### “isLeverageEnabled” is true by default

**Severity** : Medium

**Status** : Resolved

**Description**

In the Vault.sol contract, there's a boolean called `isLeverageEnabled` that should be (false) to start. This ensures only PositionManager.sol can manage positions. But, the boolean is mistakenly left (true) when the contract is first set up. This mistake lets anyone directly use the Vault.sol to open positions right away, skipping important checks in  `_validateIncreaseOrder` (PositionManager.sol).

https://github.com/zkDX-DeFi/Smart_Contracts/blob/35f1d4b887bd5b0fc580b7d9fe951c4b550c9897/contracts/core/Vault.sol#L148

**Recommendation**

it is recommended to explicitly initialize the `isLeverageEnabled` flag to false within the Vault contract's constructor. This change ensures that leverage-related operations are disabled by default, requiring explicit authorization (typically from an admin or through a governance process) to enable such features

```sol
constructor() public {
    gov = msg.sender;
    isLeverageEnabled = false; // Ensure leverage is disabled by default.
}
```

### Unbounded Iteration Leading to Potential Service Blockage

**Severity** : Medium

**Status** : Resolved

**Description**

`Vault.sol:setTokenConfig` due to the absence of a limit on the number of whitelisted tokens. This can lead to scenarios where operations iterating over these tokens consume more gas than the maximum allowed in a block, potentially causing transactions to fail and, in severe cases, blocking the service entirely.

**Recommendations**

Set a Maximum Cap: Implement a cap for the maximum number of whitelisted tokens. This ensures that the list cannot grow indefinitely and operations on the list stay within the block gas limit.

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_WHITELISTED_TOKENS = 100; // Example maximum number
```

### Incorrect Fee Calculation Due to Outdated `ZKUSDAmounts` Value

**Severity** : Medium

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description**

The ZKLP is engineered to rebalance using a dynamic fee structure (source: https://docs.zkdx.io/litepaper/usdzklp#usdzklp-rebalance ) . However, in the `VaultUtils#getFeeBasisPoints` function, where the determination of whether an action is contributing towards or moving away from the desired rate relies on outdated values from the `zkusdAmounts[_token]` mapping.

This mapping holds the USD value cached at the time of an action's execution ( https://github.com/zkDX-DeFi/Smart_Contracts/blob/35f1d4b887bd5b0fc580b7d9fe951c4b550c9897/contracts/core/VaultUtils.sol#L73 ). If there is a significant price fluctuation in the token value after this point, the cached value will not be updated to reflect this change. As a result, the rebalancing mechanism may inaccurately assess the direction of the action relative to the target weight, potentially leading to the imposition of incorrect fees. In the worst-case scenario, this could result in the rebalancing process moving in the opposite direction of its intended goal.

**Exploit Scenario**:

Assume the ZKLP aims for a 50-50 weight between DAI and USDT.
Initially, the pool contains 1 DAI (priced at $100) and $100 USDT, perfectly balanced.
If the price of DAI drops to $50, the pool would have $50 worth of DAI and $50 USDT, unbalancing the pool.
When a user attempts to buy ZKUSD with DAI at this point, the optimal behavior would be to encourage adding DAI to the pool by charging a lower fee. However, due to the outdated ZKUSD[DAI] = 100, the system incorrectly perceives adding DAI as diverging further from the target weight, thus charging an extra fee instead.

**Recommendation**

Implementing real-time value updates or a mechanism that can more accurately determine the direction of balance relative to the target weight without relying solely on cached values could be potential solutions.


### Preventing Unauthorized ZKLP Token Creation

**Severity** : Medium

**Status** : Resolved

**Description**

The `ZkdlpManager.sol:getAum` function, presents two primary issues:

Denial of Service (DoS) Risk: The function iterates over all tokens listed in the `allWhitelistedTokens` array. If the governance role, through `VaultSettings.sol:setTokenConfig`, adds a substantial number of tokens, it could lead to a situation where the loop exhausts the gas limit, causing a DoS scenario.
Duplicate Token Counting: The `Vault.sol:clearTokenConfig` function fails to remove tokens from the `allWhitelistedTokens` array upon clearance. If a token is subsequently re-added, it results in its duplication within the array. Consequently, the `getAum` function would count such tokens multiple times, inaccurately increasing the Assets Under Management (AUM) calculation. This discrepancy adversely affects the `ZkdlpManager.sol:_addLiquidity` function, leading to the minting of fewer ZKLP tokens than appropriate (since an inflated AUM results in reduced mint amounts).

**Exploit Scenario**:

Governance adds the USDStable token to the pool.
USDStable was later removed due to declining reputation.
USDStable is re-added after its reputation and popularity recover.
ZKLP tokens are minted in smaller amounts due to the inflated AUM calculation.

**Recommendation**:

Modify `Vault.sol:clearTokenConfig` to ensure that tokens are properly removed from the `allWhitelistedTokens` array when cleared. This change prevents the double-counting of tokens in AUM calculations.
Consider implementing mechanisms to prevent potential DoS attacks due to excessive iteration. This could include setting a limit on the number of tokens that can be added.

```solidity
function clearTokenConfig(address _token) external override {
    _onlyGov();
    require(whitelistedTokens[_token], "Token not whitelisted");
    totalTokenWeights = totalTokenWeights.sub(tokenWeights[_token]);
    
    // Properly removing the token from allWhitelistedTokens array
    for (uint i = 0; i < allWhitelistedTokens.length; i++) {
        if (allWhitelistedTokens[i] == _token) {
            allWhitelistedTokens[i] = allWhitelistedTokens[allWhitelistedTokens.length - 1];
            allWhitelistedTokens.pop();
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Clearing token configurations
    delete whitelistedTokens[_token];
    delete tokenDecimals[_token];
    delete tokenWeights[_token];
    delete minProfitBasisPoints[_token];
    delete maxZkusdAmounts[_token];
    delete stableTokens[_token];
    delete shortableTokens[_token];
    whitelistedTokenCount = whitelistedTokenCount.sub(1);
}
```


### Governance control is centralized through a single gov address.

**Severity** : Medium

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description**

The contract `VaultPriceFeed` employs a single gov address for critical governance actions, it introduces a significant risk by creating a single point of failure. If the private key associated with the gov address is compromised, an attacker gains the capability to manipulate crucial contract settings, potentially leading to system-wide vulnerabilities or exploitation.

https://github.com/zkDX-DeFi/Smart_Contracts/blob/35f1d4b887bd5b0fc580b7d9fe951c4b550c9897/contracts/core/VaultPriceFeed.sol#L13

**Recommendation**

Decentralized Governance Control: Implement a multi-signature mechanism or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure for critical governance decisions.

Emergency Stop Mechanism: Introduce an emergency stop feature that can be activated by multiple parties in case of a detected compromise. This can halt critical contract functions until a thorough investigation is conducted.

Transparency and Monitoring: Maintain transparency about governance actions with the community or stakeholders. Implement monitoring and alert systems for governance-related activities to detect unusual patterns that may indicate a compromise.

## Low Risk

### Use of single step ownership transfer

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description** : 

In the Vault contract which allows changing the gov address in the abstract `vaultSetting` & In `VaultPriceFeed` it allowed to change gov address using `setGov` function However, this contract does not implement a 2-step-process for transferring ownership. If the admin’s address is set incorrectly, this could potentially result in critical functionalities becoming locked. 

**Recommendation** : 

Consider implementing a two-step pattern. Utilize OpenZeppelin's Ownable2Step contract.


### Lack of Event Emission After Sensitive Actions

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description** :

The system exhibits a lack of event emissions following the execution of sensitive actions across multiple contracts, decreasing transparency and making tracking transactions difficult. Specifically:


In the vault contract, the `withdrawFees` function allows the withdrawal of accumulated fees to any address but does not emit an event upon completion.
The `VaultPriceFeed` contract interacts with the Pyth Oracle for managing price feeds of various tokens. It includes critical functions like `setValidTime`, `setFeedIds`, `setPyth`, and `setStableToken` that alter the state of the contract without emitting events after execution. 

**Recommendation** : 

It is recommended to define and emit events for all critical state-changing operations within the contracts, including successful fee withdrawals and any changes made through the `VaultPriceFeed` contract's functions. Details such as the token address, amount withdrawn, receiver's address, and the specific state changes made should be included in these events to enhance transparency and facilitate tracking.
		

### Inadequate Handling of Fee on Transfer Tokens


**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description** :

The smart contract's mechanisms for handling token transfers, particularly in functions like `directPoolDeposit`, `buyZKUSD`, `sellZKUSD`, `swap`, `increasePosition`, `decreasePosition`, and related liquidity and position management operations, do not account for tokens that deduct fees on transfers. When interacting with fee on transfer (FoT) tokens, the actual amount received by the contract can be less than the amount sent, due to these tokens deducting a fee from transfers for rewards, burning, or other purposes. This discrepancy can lead to inconsistencies in accounting, where the contract believes more tokens are deposited or withdrawn than actually are, potentially affecting pool balances, user balances, and the accuracy of position valuations.

**Recommendation**: 

Detect and Reject FoT Tokens: Implement checks to identify and reject fee on transfer tokens, preventing their use in the protocol. This can be done through static analysis or dynamic checks at the time of deposit or interaction.


### Stale Price Exploitation Due to Manipulable validTime

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description** :

The `VaultPriceFeed` contract fetches asset prices from the Pyth Oracle for financial operations within a DeFi platform. A critical vulnerability exists due to the mutable `validTime` state variable, which governs the maximum allowed age for price data. If `validTime` is set too high (either maliciously by a compromised governance or accidentally), the contract may accept stale prices as current, leading to potential exploitation in trading, loan issuance, and liquidation processes.

**Scenario** : 

An attacker gains control over the governance address or persuades governance to increase the `validTime` significantly (e.g., to several days or more). They then wait for a significant price movement in an asset that would normally invalidate outdated oracle data. Because of the extended `validTime`, the contract continues to use the stale price, allowing the attacker to execute trades or loans against the DeFi platform at outdated and favorable rates, leading to potential profit at the expense of the platform and its users.

**Initial Setup**: The VaultPriceFeed contract has validTime set to 3 seconds, ensuring price data is fresh.

**Compromise**: The attacker, having governance control, sets validTime to 86400 seconds (1 day).

**Exploitation**: The attacker observes that the price of TokenA has significantly dropped in external markets but is still high in the Pyth Oracle due to a lack of updates within the last day. They use this stale price to liquidate positions or take out loans at far more favorable terms than the current market conditions would allow.

**Recommendation** :

it is recommended to implement a hard cap on the `validTime` variable. This hard cap would act as an upper limit to how long price data can be considered valid, regardless of governance actions


### Missing events for `VaultPriceFeed`

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description** : 

Missing events for critical functions in `VaultPriceFeed.sol` such as `setGov()`, `setValidTime()`, `setStableToken()`, `setPyth()` and `updatePriceFeeds()`.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider adding events for functions with critical state changes as it would be a best practice for offchain monitoring.

### Usage of `getPriceUnsafe` should be avoided

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description** : 

It is advised to use `pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan()` instead of `pyth.getPriceUnsafe()` in VaultPriceFeed.sol. This is because `getPriceNoOlderThan()` already has necessary sanity checks built in to ensure that the price is no older than the age time period. Also read the documentation of `PythStructs.Price` to understand how to use this safely. 
Refer- https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-sdk-solidity/blob/main/IPyth.sol#L36 


**Recommendation**: 

Use `pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan()` rather than using `pyth.getPriceUnsafe()`.

### Missing zero address check in `setGov()` of `VaultPriceFeed`

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description** : 

VaultPriceFeed.sol has missing zero address check in `setGov()` for `_gov` address parameter. This can lead to the gov being accidentally set as zero address, leading to `onlyGov` function being uncallable forever. 
The same issue exists in the VaultSettings contract which the Vault.sol contract inherits. Setting gov as zero address here would lead to `withdrawFees()` being uncallable amongst other functions, leading to stuck fees in the Vault. 

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add a zero address check for the same.

### Use of pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description**


The code contains "pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;"
In the later Solidity versions it is no longer necessary to use the "experimental" version.
Using experimental constructions is not recommended for production code.

See: Layout of a Solidity Source File — Solidity 0.8.25 documentation (soliditylang.org)

https://github.com/zkDX-DeFi/Smart_Contracts/blob/35f1d4b887bd5b0fc580b7d9fe951c4b550c9897/contracts/core/PositionManager.sol#L3

**Recommendation** 

Replace “pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;”  with “pragma abicoder v2”; 

And make sure you use at least solidity version 0.7.5


### Old Solidity Version

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description**

Contracts Vault.sol, BasePriceConsumer.sol, PositionManager.sol are using solidity version 0.6.x, we recommend using the latest stable version of Solidity.

### `_liquidationFeeUsd` and `_fundingRateFactor` Initialization Checks

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description**

The initialize function in Vault.sol should include checks to ensure that `_liquidationFeeUsd` and `_fundingRateFactor` are less than or equal to their respective maximum allowed values (`MAX_LIQUIDATION_FEE_USD` and `MAX_FUNDING_RATE_FACTOR`). This is important to prevent setting these parameters to values that could destabilize the contract's economic mechanisms or create unintended behavior.

**Recommendations**

To address this, you can add `require` statements in the `initialize` function to validate these conditions:
```solidity
require(_liquidationFeeUsd <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_FEE_USD, "Liquidation fee exceeds maximum");
require(_fundingRateFactor <= MAX_FUNDING_RATE_FACTOR, "Funding rate factor exceeds maximum");
```
### Receiver Address Checks for Zero Address

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description**

Functions like `sellZKUSD`, `buyZKUSD`, `swap`, `increasePosition`, and `decreasePosition` should include checks to ensure that the `_receiver` address is not the zero address. This is a common practice to prevent funds from being sent to an unrecoverable address.

**Recommendations**

```solidity
require(_receiver != address(0), "Receiver cannot be the zero address");
```

### Hardcoded Stable Token Price in VaultPriceFeed.sol

Severity : Low

Status : Acknowledged

Description

In the VaultPriceFeed.sol contract, the price of stable tokens is hardcoded as 1e30, it assumes that all stable tokens will indefinitely maintain their peg to their underlying assets. This assumption poses a risk if a stable token significantly depegs, yet the system continues to treat it as if it were still pegged, potentially leading to inaccurate valuations and operations based on these prices.

https://github.com/zkDX-DeFi/Smart_Contracts/blob/35f1d4b887bd5b0fc580b7d9fe951c4b550c9897/contracts/core/VaultPriceFeed.sol#L27C1-L28C25

Recommendation

Fallback Mechanism:  In cases where a stable token's price deviates significantly from its peg, introduce fallback mechanisms such as temporary suspension of operations for the affected token or automatic adjustments to its valuation within the system.

## Informational

### Avoid using TWAPs as `PriceFeeds`

**Severity** : Informational

**Status** : Acknowledged

**Description** :

In the `_update()` function, the `priceFeed` is being assigned here:
```solidity
IVaultPriceFeed priceFeed = IVaultPriceFeed(_IVault.priceFeed());
```
The price feed is assigned in the Vault contract. If TWAPs or Time Weighted Average Prices from DEXs are used for prices, then it can result it Oracle manipulation attacks.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised not to use any TWAP oracles as its price is manipulatable. It is advised to use oracles such as Chainlink, Tellor, Witnet, etc.
