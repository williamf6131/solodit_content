# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Centralization risk in several methods

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract cloudX_staker.sol and contract cloudX_rewardLocker.sol, method emergencyWithdrawErc20() allows the owner to withdraw all the cLFi tokens that can lead to denial of service for users. 
Similarly, method addNRemoveAdmin(...) allows the admin to add any address for access to all the other methods in both contracts.

**Recommendation** 

It is advised to decentralize the usage of these functions by using a multisig wallet with at least 2/3 or a 3/5 configuration of trusted users. Alternatively, a secure governance mechanism can be utilized for the same. 

## Low Risk

### The stake method allows staking 0 tokens

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


In contract cloudX_staker.sol, the method stake(...) allows users to stake 0 tokens because of the following logic:
```solidity
require(
lastStakedValue <= _amount,
"amount should be greater than previous stake "
);
uint256 currentValue = _amount - lastStakedValue; // @audit 0 can be allowed
lastStakedValue = _amount;
```
If lastStakedValue == amount then currentValue will be 0. 

**Recommendation**: 

Update the require statement as following
```solidity
require(
lastStakedValue < _amount,
"amount should be greater than previous stake "
);
```

### Potential discrepancy between the real and recorded value of the staked token

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The stake function within cloudXStake enables tokens to be transferred to the contract, updating the totalStaked variable in the process. On the other hand, the emergencyWithdrawErc20 function gives the owner the ability to withdraw any ERC20 token, including the cLFi token, from the contract. However, if cLFi tokens are withdrawn using the emergencyWithdrawErc20 method, the totalStaked variable remains unchanged. This leads to a discrepancy between the actual balance of cLFi tokens in the contract and the recorded totalStaked amount.

**Recommendation**:

Decrease the totalStaked value in case of cLFI token emergency withdrawal.




## Underflow revert possible in distributeFromPoolWallet method

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract cloudX_rewardLocker.sol, the method distributeFromPoolWallet(...) can run into underflow revert due to following logic:

uint256 hotWalletAmount = _withdrawReward - _autoCompoundAmount; // @audit underflow possible revert

Here it is not checked if _withdrawReward >= _autoCompoundAmount other it will be underflow revert.

**Recommendation**: 

Add to check to ensure _withdrawReward >= _autoCompoundAmount 





## Informational


### Lack of check for critical addresses initialization

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contracts allows for the transfer of cLFi tokens through functions such as transferTotalReward and unstake. However, the essential addresses are set using the setTokenWallet function, and there is no mechanism in place to ensure these addresses have been set before allowing token transfers.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a mechanism, such as a boolean flag (e.g., addressesInitialized) that is set to true only after setTokenWallet has been successfully called. Then, within the mentioned functions, add a requirement to check that this flag is set to true before proceeding with any token transfers.




### No check for amount > 0

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract cloudX_staker.sol and contract cloudX_rewardLocker.sol, the method emergencyWithdraw(..) does not check if the parameter _amount is zero. 

In contract cloudX_rewardLocker.sol, the method distributeTotalReward(...) does not check if all the 3 parameters are not zero amount.

In contract cloudX_rewardLocker.sol, the method distributeFromPoolwallet(...) does not check if all the 2 parameters are not zero amount.

**Recommendation**: 

Add checks to ensure passed amount is greater than 0.






### No check for address(0)

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract cloudX_staker.sol and contract cloudX_rewardLocker.sol, the method setTokenWallet(...) does not check for address(0). If address(0) is passed, owner will have to make another transaction to set the correct address which will be a waste of gas.

**Recommendation**: 

Add checks to ensure passed parame is not addressed (0).





### Update the error message typo and check

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract  cloudX_staker.sol and contract cloudX_rewardLocker.sol, the following require statement error message through out both contracts needs to be updated.
```solidity
require(
owner() == msg.sender || adminList[msg.sender] == true,
"address cannot transfered"
);
Recommendation: Update transfered to transfer.
require(
owner() == msg.sender || adminList[msg.sender],
"address cannot transfer"
);
```


### Update NatSpec comments

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**


Method emergencyWithdrawErc20() missing NatSpec comments for _amount parameter in both contracts.

Method setTokenWallet(...) in Contract cloudX_rewardLocker.sol has the wrong comment for _poolWallet, _hotWallet, and _stakeContract parameters.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the natspec comments.

**Fix**: Partially fixed.



### Contracts do not check if enough tokens balance to transfer

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

Method unstake(...) and transferTotalReward(...) do not check if the contract has enough balance to transfer the cLFi tokens.

**Recommendation**: Add checks to ensure the contract has enough balance to transfer.

**Fix**: Fix is incorrect for transferTotalReward(...) method and the test is failing. We need to check if the contract has enough balance to transfer, not the rewardWallet.
Similarly, we need to check the same in unstake(...) method.
