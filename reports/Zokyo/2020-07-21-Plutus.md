# Findings

## High Risk

### The risk of wrong vesting calculations

**Description**

All the vesting start periods are based on the “TGE” value but there is no validation of its value
in the functions that are using this value.

**Recommendation**:

Create a separate validation for non-zero “TGE” value.

**Re-audit comment**:

Resolved.

### Wrong transfer behavior of Bonded and Unbonded contracts

**Description**

According to the provided document, there should be an ability to transfer only to the
Unbonded contract address and there should also be an ability to transfer tokens from
Unbonded contracts to the Bonded contract but it is not implemented.

**Recommendation**:

Set up transfer permissions according to the documentation.

**Re-audit comment**:

Resolved. On the call with client 18.07.2020 they mentioned it is not a valid condition
anymore.

## Medium Risk

### Wrong Seed sale bridge fee calculation

**Description**

Method claimSeedTokens depends on method getCurrentFee, that is valid only if TGE is set, but
method claimSeedTokens could be called even before property TGE is set.

**Recommendation**:

Method claimSeedTokens should have extra check if property TGE is already initialized.

**Re-audit comment**:

Resolved.

## Low Risk

### The owner has too many permissions

**Description**

According to the contract code, there is an ability to execute claim functions by the owner that
allows them to spend tokens from any allocation group. Such functionality is not required by
documentation.

**Recommendation**:

Discard the conditions that are not required to avoid tokens manipulation from the owner
account (by mistake or in the case of losing access to the owner account).

**Re-audit comment**:

Resolved. On the call with client 18.07.2020 it was marked as expected behavior.

### Incorrect behaviour of private tokens claiming

**Description**

It is expected that the function claimPrivateTokens (lines 464-473) of Unbonded smart contract
should have an ability to claim tokens by the owner of the contract but it is not implemented.

**Recommendation**:

Change function according to its description. On the other hand, it is better to allocate all the
required tokens directly to holders - it allows avoiding fee double-spending for addToWhitelist
and claimPrivateTokens functions execution.

**Re-audit comment**:

Resolved. The client is aware of such flow and mentioned it’s expected behaviour for them.
