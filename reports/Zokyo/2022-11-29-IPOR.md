# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Transfer result value ignored in John.sol

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract John.sol, in function unstake(address, uint256) at line 194 the transfer call performed has an ignored result value. This can lead to undefined behavior in case the transfer call fails but the transaction is not reverted.

**Recommendation**: 

Use safeTransfer from imported SafeERC20Upgradeable.

**NOTE**: The tokens used in that particular context are developed by IPOR Labs and taking in consideration the relation between IPOR product and IPOR Labs there is no need for safeTransfer added verification.


### Transfer result value ignored in PwIporToken.sol

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract PwIporToken.sol in functions unstake and redeem at lines 122 and 182 the transfer calls performed ignore the result value. This can lead to undefined behavior in case the transfer call fails but the transaction is not reverted.


**Recommendation**: 

Use safeTransfer from imported SafeERC20Upgradeable
**NOTE**: The tokens used in that particular context are developed by IPOR Labs and taking in consideration the relation between IPOR product and IPOR Labs there is no need for safeTransfer added verification.




### Config param sanity check

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract “PwIporTokenInternal”, in function “setWithdrawalFee”, there is no sanity check for the “withdrawalFee” parameter. This can generate a wrong assignment even if the route can only be accessed by the owner of the contract. If the value of the "withdrawalFee" variable will be greater than 1e18, the "_amountWithoutFee" function will always revert. This behavior will make the function "unstake", from the "PwIporToken" contract, unusable because the "_amountWithoutFee" is used there.

**Recommendation**:  

Add a sanity check in the “setWithdrawalFee”  function to ensure that “_withdrawalFee” will not exceed 1e18.

## Low Risk

### Misleading use of msg.sender in protected method in JohnInternal.sol

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract PwIporTokenInternal.sol in function receiveRewards at line 88, inside the safeTransferFrom call the msg.sender is user although the function is protected and can only be called by John.sol. This is misleading because msg.sender will always have the value of John address. Using msg.sender in this case also implies that the function might be called through a delegate call from john, which might not be the wanted behavior.

**Description**:

Use the _john address instead of msg.sender value

 
### External view depends on msg.sender value in JohnInternal.sol

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract JohnInternal.sol, in view accountParams at line 67, the returned value is dependent on msg.sender value. Given accountParams is external the call to it would result in default values as msg.sender would be 0x0 address. This might not be the expected behavior for external consumers.

**Recommendation**: 

Add the account address as parameter and use it instead of msg.sender

### External view depends on msg.sender value in PwIporToken.sol

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract PwIporToken.sol, in view activeCoolDown at line 72, the returned value is dependent on msg.sender value. Given activeCoolDown is external the call to it would result in default values as msg.sender would be 0x0 address. This might not be the expected behavior for external consumers.

**Recommendation**: 

Add the account address as parameter and use it instead of msg.sender



### Simultaneously iterate over arrays which can be of different length

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract "JohnInternal", in the "delegatePwIpor" function, "ipTokens" and "pwTokenAmounts" arrays are iterated simultaneously. If their lengths are different, an unexpected behavior can occur.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check to ensure that arrays have both the same length and revert otherwise.

**Note**: The team have choosed to not implement this recommendation as the check for the array length it is already implemented in the contract in a different function that is calling the internal function mentioned in the text.

## Informational

### Variables shadowing functions with the same name in John.sol and JohnInternal.sol

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contracts John.sol and JohnInternal.sol there are multiple cases of function shadowing because of variables with the same name. This creates confusion while reading the contracts and given that most of the functions are views, it’s counterintuitive to call a view that has the same name as some internal function variable.
The shadowing cases can be found in following functions and lines:
John.sol, in accountRewards(address) at lines 71,72; globalParams and accountParams variables
John.sol, in accruedRewards(address) at lines 79,72; globalParams variable
John.sol, stake(address, uint256) at lines 135, 138; globalParams and accountParams variables
John.sol, unstake(address, uint256) at lines 169, 170; globalParams and accountParams variables
John.sol, claim(address, uint256) at lines 200, 203; globalParams and accountParams variables
JohnInternal.sol, setRewardsPerBlock(address, uint256, uint32) at line 72; globalParams variable

**Recommendation**: 

Prefix the views with get in the interfaces and do consequent changes in contracts implementing these. It should fix all the shadowing issues.

### Unused parameters in JohnInternal.sol

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contracts JohnInternal.sol in function _claim at lines 298-306 there are unused function parameters. These are: address ipToken, JohnTypes.AccountRewardsParams memory accountParams, JohnTypes.GlobalRewardsParams memory globalParams.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the unused variables.


 
### Use of reason strings instead of custom errors

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Inside the contracts the reason strings from MiningErrors are used when reverting. An alternative would be to use custom errors. This contributes to reducing contract size and reducing overall gas cost.

**Recommendation**: 

Change reason strings from MiningErrors library to custom errors.

**Note**: The development team have choosed to stick with the actual format as the errors are described in the documentation


### State mutability can be changed to pure for math functions in MiningCalculation.sol

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In library MiningCalculation.sol some of the views’ state mutability can be changed to pure as these are supposed to do stateless calculations. Functions that can be changed to pure are:
calculateAccruedRewards
compositeMultiplierCumulative
compositeMultiplier
calculateAccountRewards
_toFixedPoint (consider removing the _ prefix as it breaks the rules defined for the linter)

**Recommendation**: 

Consider changing from view to pure for the functions above

### Variables shadowing functions with the same name in MiningCalculation.sol

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the library MiningCalculation.sol there are multiple cases of function shadowing because of variables with the same name.
The shadowing cases can be found in following functions and lines:
compositeMultiplierCumulative at line 87; compositeMultiplier variable
calculateAccountRewards at line 114; compositeMultiplierCumulative variable

**Recommendation**: 

Consider renaming the variables or changing the functions signatures by prefixing with some like “compute”.




### Variables shadowing functions with the same name in PwIporToken.sol and PwIporTokenInternal.sol

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contracts PwIporToken.sol and PwIporTokenInternal.sol there are multiple cases of function shadowing because of variables with the same name. This creates confusion while reading the contracts and given that most of the functions are views, it’s counterintuitive to call a view that has the same name as some internal function variable.
The shadowing cases can be found in following functions and lines:
PwIporToken.sol, in stake(uint256) at line 82; exchangeRate variable
PwIporToken.sol, in unstake(uint256) at line 100; exchangeRate variable
PwIporToken.sol, in redeem() at lines 163 and 167; coolDown and exchangeRate variables
PwIporTokenInternal.sol, in receiveRewards(address, uint256) at line 84; exchangeRate variable

**Recommendation**: 

Prefix the views with get in the interfaces and do consequent changes in contracts implementing these. It should fix all the shadowing issues.









### Reentrancy state mutability pattern not followed 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In contract “PwIporTokenInternal”, the function “receiveRewards” does not respect the check-effect-interact pattern which my cause unpredicted behaviour in future, as a best practice rule is best to always implement this pattern.

**Recommendation**: 

Refactor the function to be completely compatible with the check-effect-interact pattern by moving the external call down in the order of operation executed.


### Refactor from memory to calldata to save gas where possible

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the contract “John”, at line 19, function balanceOfDelegatePwIpor, there could be an optimization make to save some gas by refactoring requestIpTokens parameter from memory to calldata, as calldata is the cheapest form of data and it can only be present in the external function arguments where the data is only used for read-only purposes, the same optimization can be make in contract “JohnInternal”, functions “delegatePwIpor”, “delegatePwIporAndStakeIpToken”, “undelegatePwIpor” and in contract “PowerIpor”, functions “delegateToJohn”, “delegateAndStakeToJohn”,  “undelegateFromJohn”.

**Recommendation**: 

Refactor from memory to calldata.
