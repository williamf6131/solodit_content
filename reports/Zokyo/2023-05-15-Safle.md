## Medium Risk

###  UNFILTERED TOKENS  LEADS CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING

**Severity**: Medium 

**Status**: Resolved

**Location** : @getsafle/asset-controller


**Description**  : 

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. During the test, it is seen that there is no input/output filtering on the vault SDK.

getEthAssets,  getPolygonAssets and getBSCAssets  these functions detect tokens for a specific user address on a given blockchain network. If an attacker deploys a malicious smart contract with an XSS payload and adds it to the user's wallet, the detectTokens function may parse and include this malicious token as well. This can potentially compromise the user's wallet and lead to loss of funds or data.

**A proof-of-concept (PoC) for this attack could involve the following steps**:

The attacker deploys a malicious ERC20 token smart contract with an XSS payload on the Ethereum, Polygon, or BSC blockchain network.


The attacker adds this malicious token to the victim's wallet address.
The getEthAssets, getPolygonAssets, or getBSCAssets function is called for the victim's wallet address.
The function detects the malicious token and includes it in the list of tokens.
The malicious payload in the token is executed when the victim accesses or interacts with it, potentially compromising the victim's wallet.

**Impact**:

An attacker could use this vulnerability to inject a malicious payload into a token's name and execute arbitrary code on the user's device when they view their wallet. This could lead to sensitive data theft, financial losses, or other malicious activities.

**Recommendation**: 

The vulnerability can be fixed by sanitizing the token data before displaying them to the user. The library should use a DOM sanitizer, such as DOMPurify, to sanitize the token names before rendering them

### Title: Brute Force Attack on PIN in Keyring

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location** : 

https://github.com/getsafle/safle-vault/blob/main/src/lib/keyring.js#L19
https://github.com/getsafle/safle-vault/blob/main/src/lib/keyring.js#L129

**Precondition**: 

The Keyring allows users to set a 6-digit numeric PIN to access their encrypted mnemonic phrase. The exportMnemonic function in the Keyring allows the user to export their mnemonic phrase by providing the correct PIN.

**Description** : 


The current implementation of the exportMnemonic function is vulnerable to a brute force attack on the PIN. An attacker can use automated tools to try different combinations of 6-digit numbers until they find the correct PIN to access the user's mnemonic phrase.

**Impact**:

 A successful brute force attack on the PIN can allow an attacker to access the user's encrypted mnemonic phrase, which can lead to the theft of their cryptocurrency assets. The impact of this vulnerability can be severe, as the loss of cryptocurrency assets can be irreversible.

**Recommendation**:

 To fix the brute force attack vulnerability, the Keyring should implement measures to prevent automated brute force attacks on the PIN. This can be achieved by adding a delay between PIN validation attempts, implementing rate-limiting to limit the number of attempts within a certain time period or implementing multi-factor authentication. Additionally, enforcing stronger PIN requirements, such as longer and more complex PINs, can make it harder for attackers to guess the correct PIN. Implementing these measures can significantly reduce the risk of a successful brute-force attack on the PIN.

## Low Risk

### Information Leakage through Error Messages

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The  functions in the vault and keyring returns an error message with a predefined constant, ERROR_MESSAGE.INCORRECT_PIN_TYPE, when the provided PIN does not meet the required criteria. While this error message provides helpful feedback to the user, it also reveals information about the expected format of the PIN.
An attacker could potentially use this information to narrow down the search space when attempting a brute-force attack on the PIN. Although the risk associated with this issue is low, it's generally a good practice to avoid providing specific details about expected input formats in error messages.

**Recommendation**:

Consider using a more generic error message when the provided PIN does not meet the required criteria, such as "Invalid PIN provided." This will provide the user with feedback while minimizing the information revealed to potential attackers.

**Fixed**:

## Informational

### Outdated or Untrusted Dependencies

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

 The Vault and keyring class implementation uses several third-party packages. Outdated or untrusted dependencies can introduce security vulnerabilities to the application.
https://github.com/getsafle/safle-vault/blob/main/package.json

**Recommendation**: 

Regularly update all dependencies to their latest versions and ensure they come from reputable sources. Perform periodic security audits on these packages to reduce the risk of potential vulnerabilities.
