# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Absence of Rate Limiting on Critical Endpoints(All servers URLs)

**Severity**: Medium

**Status** : Acknowledged 

**Description**:

Several endpoints in the Hinkal Protocol, particularly those involved in sensitive operations such as the https://polygon.server.hinkal.pro/users/0xC6Cd9d90F1323308B49891175572B78cdd83eCFF/signature/3634466890077726613834358079071544370178637806986139059296860288151097002195/kyc/
 function, do not implement rate limiting. This absence of rate limiting poses a significant risk as it allows attackers to send a high volume of requests in a short period. Such unrestricted access can lead to various issues, including resource exhaustion, degraded performance, and potentially, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Overloading the server with requests could disrupt the service for legitimate users and might also expose the server to further vulnerabilities as it struggles to handle the load.
Proof of Concept/Scenario:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the endpoint with different Ethereum addresses or even the same address. This could be automated using a script that rapidly sends requests, aiming to overwhelm the server. Such an attack could degrade the performance of the server, leading to slow response times or complete denial of service for other users.

**Recommendation**:

Implement Rate Limiting: Introduce rate limiting on all sensitive endpoints, including /users. The rate limits should be configured based on typical user behavior and the server's capacity.
**Comment from Client**  : #1 We are aware of this issue, however some users have issues using the app if we enable rate-limiting.
Thus, we have chosen not to enable it and instead, we closely monitor the traffic on the server to identify if any kind of DOS attack is taking place.

## Low Risk

### Insufficient Signature Verification

**Severity**: Low

**Status** : Resolved


**Description**: 

In hexagate-callback.ts the endpoint conditionally checks the IS_HEXAGATE_SIGNATURE_DISABLED flag to determine whether to verify the x-hexagate-signature header. If this flag is disabled, the endpoint processes requests without validating their authenticity, leading to a security risk.


**Code Snippet**:

 ```js
if (!IS_HEXAGATE_SIGNATURE_DISABLED) {
    const hexagateSignature = req.headers['x-hexagate-signature'];
    // ... signature verification logic ...
}
```

**POC/Scenario**: 

An attacker could exploit this by sending a spoofed request when the signature verification is disabled, possibly leading to unauthorized actions 

**Recommendation**: 

Always enforce signature verification for incoming requests to ensure data integrity and source authenticity. Remove the conditional check and consistently validate the signature.


**Client comment** : 

The check in question was only being used for local testing and not production environment.However we understand the pontential issue that it can cause.Thus we have resolved the issue by enforcing that the signature verification takes place at all times.


### Potential Exposure to Enumeration Attacks\

**Severity**: Low

**Status** : Resolved 

**Description**: 

In user-get-signature.ts throwing a UserDoesNotExistError when a user is not found can lead to user enumeration attacks, where an attacker can determine if a user exists in the system.


**Code Snippet**:

 
if (!user) throw new UserDoesNotExistError();

POC/Scenario: 

An attacker could systematically try different Ethereum addresses to infer which ones are registered in the system.

**Recommendation**:

 Return a generic message that does not indicate whether the user exists or not, to avoid giving away information about  the user's address.


**Client comment** : We have resolved this issue. Now, instead of throwing an error, we just return `False` as a response indicating that KYC/KYB verification is not complete for the user in question.

### Lack of Input Validation in react/src/hooks/useDeposit  

**Severity**: Low

**Status** : Resolved  

**Description**:

The function only checks the first element of the amountChanges array for validation. It does not validate the entire array or the erc20Addresses array. This might lead to issues if the arrays contain invalid or inconsistent data.
**Scenario/POC**:
An attacker could potentially pass an array with the first element as a valid amount and subsequent elements as invalid or malicious data, which might not be properly handled by the system.

**Recommendation**:

Perform thorough validation on all elements of the erc20Addresses and amountChanges arrays. Ensure that all addresses are valid and that all amounts are appropriate for the transaction.
**Client comment** : 
We only check the first element of the array as the array should only have one element incase of deposits.
However, we have introduced additional check to ensure that the array only has 1 element.

### Insufficient Validation Checks in react/src/hooks/useSwap

**Severity**: Low

**Status** : Resolved 

**Code Snippet**:
```js
const swap = useCallback(
  async (erc20Addresses: string[], amountChanges: bigint[], externalActionId: ExternalActionId, data: string) => {
    ...
    if (amountChanges[0] === 0n) {
      throw new Error(transactionErrorCodes.AMOUNT_EMPTY);
    }
    // TODO: Add other validators
    ...
  },
  [hinkal, shieldedAddress, setTransactionStatus, requireAccessToken, runTransaction, onSuccess, onError],
);
```
**Scenario / Proof of Concept (POC)**:

The current validation in the swap function checks if the first element of amountChanges is zero but does not validate other elements in the array. There's a potential risk that invalid or malicious data could be processed, especially when the array contains more than one element. The absence of comprehensive validation could lead to unintended behavior, incorrect transaction processing, or vulnerabilities to attack vectors like denial of service or unexpected contract behavior.

**Recommendation**:

Implement comprehensive validation for all elements in the amountChanges array. This includes checking if all elements are greater than zero and whether they meet other business logic criteria (e.g., maximum allowed amount, alignment with token decimals, etc.).

**Client Comment**: 

We only check the first element of the array as the array should only have one element incase of deposits.
However, we have introduced additional check to ensure that the array only has 1 element.

### Path Disclosure in Error Response(All Relayers/Servers URLs)

**Severity**: Low

**Status** : Resolved 

**Description**:

The Hinkal Protocol's Relayer endpoint is revealing sensitive file path information in its error response when it encounters malformed JSON input. In the provided scenario, a malformed POST request to All relayers URLS /general-transact leads to an error response that includes detailed server path information such as /home/ec2-user/github/Hinkal-Protocol/node_modules/.... This information can be exploited by an attacker to gain insights about the server's directory structure, software stack, and potentially other system details, which could facilitate further attacks, such as directory traversal or targeted exploits against known vulnerabilities in the server's tech stack.

**Recommendation**:

Modify the error handling mechanism to avoid sending detailed internal error information to the client. Instead, log these details on the server for debugging purposes and return generic error messages to the client.
Implement custom error pages that provide minimal information to the end-user, ensuring that no sensitive information is leaked

**Client Comment** : 

We have resolved this issue.
We have updated code to just pass a generic error message to the client.
So that no other information is leaked.

### Server Version Disclosure

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved 

**Description** 

If you are running a web server, it often shows the world what type of server it is, its version number, and the operating system. This information is available in header fields and can be acquired using a web browser to make a simple HTTP request to any web application. It is often called the webserver banner and is ignored by most people with the exception of malicious ones.
Attackers can perform banner grabbing using even simple TCP tools like telnet or netcat. Then they launch targeted attacks against your web server and version. In addition, if a particular web server version is known to be vulnerable to a specific exploit, the attacker would just need to use that exploit as part of their assault on the target web server.

**Proof of Concept**

The following is needed in order to reproduce this issue:
 The following   call shows the application disclosing the server version in the response.

The application discloses the NGINX server version which allows an attacker to gain more information on the system.


**Recommendation**

Obscuring web server information in headers.
Using a hardened reverse proxy server to create an additional layer of security between the web server and the internet.
Ensuring that web servers are kept up-to-date with the latest software and security patches.

**Client comment** : 

We have resolved this issue by making changes to server configs to hide the version of nginx.

### Inconsistency in SSL/TLS Configuration Between  Domain and ELB Endpoint(All Servers and Relayers)

**Severity**: Low

**Status** : Resolved 

**Description**:

An inconsistency has been identified in the SSL/TLS configuration between the domain and its underlying AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) endpoint  While the domain is configured to establish a secure HTTPS connection, direct access to the ELB endpoint results in a non-secure connection. This discrepancy creates a vulnerability where sensitive data could be exposed during transmission to and from the ELB endpoint, potentially leading to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Recommendation**:

SSL/TLS Configuration for ELB:
Ensure SSL/TLS certificates are installed and correctly configured on the ELB. This ensures encryption of all data in transit.
Enforce HTTPS:
Implement a policy to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS, ensuring that no unencrypted communication occurs.
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):
Employ HSTS to force clients to use HTTPS connections only, preventing any attempts to connect via HTTP.

**Client Comment** : 

We have removed all Http port from ELB instances.
Therefore now only secured https connection can take place.
Additionally only calls via domain are accessible and direct calls to ELB will not be possible anymore.

### Components With Known Vulnerability 


**Severity** : Low

**Status**  : Resolved 

**Description**

The service depends upon several third-party software packages to operate. Any of these
components may, over time, have security vulnerabilities that are publicly disclosed and
fixed in later versions. It is a common flaw for software development to focus on
hardening the code written in-house but neglect to properly manage the dependent
third-party software packages used. Hence there should be a process for patch
management and all the software should be reviewed and updated to patch for security
issues.


The application uses an outdated NGINX 1.18.0 server version. which contains known vulnerabilities. Depending on the vulnerability exploited there could be a potential loss of data. 


**Proof of Concept**


The following is needed in order to reproduce this issue:





**Recommendation**

As a best practice, keep all software up to date, especially if there exists a known vulnerability or weakness associated with an older version. 
None of these attacks was found possible during the test, but this might change in the future if the application is found using the old component with insecure user-supplied input.

**Client comment** : 

We have resolved this issue and updated the server for nginx 1.20.



## Informational


### Remove/Resolve TODO comments

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved  

**Description** : 

The comment in react/src/hooks/useSwap.tsx
 // TODO: Add other validators indicates a known gap in the current implementation. It's crucial to address these TODOs, especially where security and accuracy are paramount.
Across the Hinkal repository, in many typescripts files , there are several TODO comments which show unresolved work and are advised to remove or resolve before deployment.

**Recommendation**: 

Resolve or remove the TODO statements. 

**Client comment** : 

The TODO: statements were old and irrelevant. I have removed all the TODO statements from codebase so that it is not confusing.
