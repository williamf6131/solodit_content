# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Insufficient Access Controls on collectPositionSwapFee Will Allow Anyone to Call This Function

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

According to the nat spec for the TeaVaultAlgebraV1Point9 contract, the fund manager should only be allowed to call collectPositionSwapFee however, there appears to be no access controls placed on the function implementation which may allow anyone to call this function.

**Recommendation**:

Add the onlyManager modifier to the collectPositionSwapFee function for the TeaVaultV1Point9 contract. 



### Users Could be Frontrun Should They Swap with an Approved swapRouter via the SwapRelayer Contract Due to a Lack of Token Transfer


**Severity**: Medium 

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**:

The swap relayer contract is responsible for facilitating swaps against whitelisted swap routers which is correct however, the swap function does not transfer funds to the contract and expects external entities to first transfer in order to swap. Should an EOA or contract integrator attempt to make a swap by first transferring to the contract, they will get frontrun as the balance of the contract is transferred to the msg.sender. 

**Recommendation**:

It’s recommended that the external entity makes a call to approval, where the swapRelayer will make a pull from the user to facilitate a swap. Once a transfer to the contract has happened, the contract can make steps to swap funds and return the amount out to the user. 

**Comment**: We are acknowledging this finding so users know that if this contract is used by users or contract integrators, they will be susceptible to frontrunning.

## Informational

### Deadline Checks Can be Done After Function Implementation for Better Code Readability

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

The TeaVaultAlgebraV1Point9 contract uses a deadline checker to assert that transactions cannot be maliciously executed by validators; however, the check can be done after the execution of the implementation as the implementation may take additional time to execute.

**Recommendation**:

It’s recommended that the checkDeadline modifier in the TeaVaultAlgebraV1Point9 Contract is modified to the following which first executes the implementation then makes a deadline check: 
```solidity
   modifier checkDeadline(uint256 _deadline) {
       _;
       _checkDeadline(_deadline);
   }
```



### Dead code contained in TeaVaultAlgebraV1Point9 

**Severity**: Informational/Gas

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

There exists code in the TeaVaultAlgebraV1Point9 contract _abs() which is never executed and is an internal function. Additional unnecessary code may contribute to the size of the contract which will require an unnecessary expenditure of gas to deploy.

**Recommendation**: 


It’s recommended that the _abs() function is removed from the aforementioned contract.
