# Findings

## Low Risk

### Centralisation Risks

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Description**

Currently, the total supply of the tokens is minted to the owner of the contract, and the distribution of tokens is controlled by the owner in KBT.sol (100000000 tokens)
Make sure the owner is a multisig account with a timelock where each multisig key resides on a different server , else the total supply of the token might be compromised.

**Recommendation**:

Make sure the owner is a multisig account with a timelock where each multisig key resides on a different server

### Use Of Ownable Can Be Skipped

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Description**

The contract uses the ownable library and mint the initial total supply to the owner , but since there are no onlyOwner functions in this token contract , this can be skipped . We can simply mint the total supply to the msg.sender in the constructor and just make sure the msg.sender is a multisig address so that funds are not centralised.

**Recommendation**:

Recommended to remove the ownable library if not required.
