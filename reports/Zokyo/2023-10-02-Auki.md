# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Possible underflow in supply calculations

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract, BurnContract.sol, in function `burn`, `currentSupplySubTargetSupply` is calculated by subtracting `TARGET_TOTAL_SUPPLY` from `currentTotalSupply`(total supply of AukiToken). If `currentTotalSupply` is smaller than `TARGET_TOTAL_SUPPLY` the subtraction will underflow. Even if it is intended behavior for the function to revert in this case, the revert should be triggered by a required statement with a proper error message.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check to ensure that currentTotalSupply is greater than `TARGET_TOTAL_SUPPLY` and revert with a proper message otherwise.


## Informational

### Require statements without a revert message

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract, `FreeStorageWallet` at lines #34 & #35 there are two require statements that don’t have a revert message.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a revert message to all the require statements

### Upgradeable contracts don’t have storage gaps

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

All the contracts also have the possibility to be upgradeable as they are implementing the UUPS pattern, however, they are not implementing storage gaps to ensure there are no storage conflicts between possible upgrade

**Recommendation**: 

Implement storage gaps in all the upgradeable contracts.
