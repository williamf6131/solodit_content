# Findings

## High Risk

### Quoter uniswap integration.

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

AirPuffHandlerM._uniswapExecution().

The function uses a quoter for getting the expected amount out without executing the swap
and uses this value as `amountOutMinimum` as a parameter for the swap. However, this
method of getting the expected amount is not recommended for use for several reasons.

The first and main reason is that using a quoter on a chain is not stable enough, which often
causes reverts. Quoter is recommended for use in the backend regarding uniswap
documentation. Also, quoter is not gas efficient method.

**Recommendation:**

Remove quoter integration in the `_uniswapExecution` function and add a more stable and
gas-efficient variant for checking the `amountOutMinimum` value by adding the
`amountOutMinimum` argument to the swap function and swap structure.

**Post audit**

Quoter was removed. Price is calculated based on the price retuned from oracle.

### Tokens can be burnt explicitly.

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

AirPuffVaultM.burnFrom(), AirPuffVault.burnFrom(), AirPuff1X.burnFrom()

Native function `burnFrom()` still can be executed, so tokens can be burnt. Since the
contracts try to disallow any burn and transfer transactions, it will be necessary to disallow
function `burnFrom()` to avoid related risks. For now the user can approve burning tokens
for himself and burn any amount.

**Recommendation:**

Add overrided `burnFrom()` function for the contracts, that disable burn.

**Post audit**

`burnFrom()` functions were disabled.

### Frontrun attack possible.

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

1. AirPuffHandlerM._curveSimpleSwap(), _curve RouterSwapWithPaths()
`_curveSimpleSwap` function uses the 'exchange function to make the swap. One of the arguments that is required for swap is responsible for the minimum amount out, but `min_dy` is always set to 0.
`_curveRouterSwapWithPaths()` function uses the 'exchange' function through router has an argument responsible for minimum, amount out, but_expected argument also always be 0.

These can cause a front-running attack as the amount is not validated for a certain desired minimum.

2. AirPuffHandlerM._swapBalancerSimple(), _swapBalancerMulti()
Both of these functions have a limits array that is responsible for setting the minimum amount of assets to receive after the swap. In both functions, the minimum amount is set to -1, which means the amount is not specified. This is also a crucial part of the swap to prevent the attack by setting the desired minimum.

**Recommendation:**

Add checks for the amount of swapped tokens to prevent possible attacks. Pass `minAmountOut` to exchange function as for `_curveSimpleSwap` and `_curveRouterSwapWithPaths`. Add minimum amount to receive in limits array in function `_swapBalancerSimple` and `_swapBalancerMulti`.
Add a modifier which will revert if `msg.sender != tx.origin`
Use modifier in the following functions:
• AirPuffVault: openPosition, closePosition, liquidatePosition
• AirPuff1X: openPosition, closePosition
• AirPuffVaultM: openPosition, closePosition, liquidatePosition
• AirPuffLendingARB: deposit, withdraw

**Post audit.**

Now, `minAmountOut` is calculated based on Chainlink or Api3Oracle oracles. The AirPuff team has also added an interface for calculating price based on several on-chain oracles (IVectorOracle). Though this approach is not implemented right now, the `AirPuff` team has prepared minor developments for it. Modifier `msg.sender != tx.origin` was added to `AirPuffVaultM` contract. Auditors highly recommend to add this modifier to other contracts as well, as an additional measure over implemented steps.

## Low Risk

### Broken logic in check.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

AirPuffHandlerM._curveRouterSwapWithPaths().

The function has two checks if any Curve pools are set. If no addresses are set, this check
will never be reached because `curvePoolsIn` and `curvePoolsOut` are structs with 5 zero
addresses by default. So, the check will always show that the Curve pools' length is greater
than zero. This can lead to problems during the swap. The issue is marked as Low-risk
because the tx will revert without losing funds, thus marking an unreachable pool.

**Recommendation:**

Change the "require" check for the correct pools in the `_curveRouterSwapWithPaths`
function. Arrays in this struct have a limited number of addresses (11), and by default, all
these addresses are equal to zero. We recommend adjusting the logic to check that at least
the first 2 addresses in both arrays do not equal zero.

**Post audit.**

The logic of the `require` check was changed as recommended; the first 2 addresses in the
swap path of the Curve router are checked for non-zero values.

## Informational

### Duplicated check.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

AirPuffHandlerM.handlerSwap(), _curveSimpleSwap().
Before processing the swap via the Сurve, the contract checks if any Curve pool is set for
the vault. If the strategy has no specific router path for chosen tokens, the contract calls the
`_curveSimpleSwap` function, which contains one more check for the pool specified for the
strategy. Since both checks are the same, the one in the `_curveSimpleSwap` function can be
removed to save some gas.

**Recommendation:**

Remove require check in `_curveSimpleSwap` function for set curve pool for the strategy.

### Routing and swap parameters must be determined off-chain.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

AirPuffHandlerM._curveRouterSwapWithPaths()
The function uses already-set parameters to make swaps through the Curve protocol with
the router. All parameters are set directly in the contract through multiple functions.
According to the Curve documentation, all these parameters should be determined off-chain
and set as arguments to function. Also, the router was designed for gas efficiency and ease
of use.

**Recommendation:**

Verify that the parameters for swapping through the curve router set on-chain correspond to
your business logic.

**Post-audit.**

The client verified, that current swap paths have enough liquidity and correspond to current
business logic.

### Lack of event emitting.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**description**

AirPuffVaultM.setProtocolFee()
This function is responsible for setting crucial addresses and fee amounts. Five parameters
participate in the setting, but only three emit in the event, which may cause some issues.

**Recommendation:**

Consider adding all values for the emitting event in setProtocolFee() OR verify that the
management fee percentage and receiver address should not be revealed in the event.

### NatSpec required.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**description**

NatSpec is a documentation format that helps in the readability of contract functions and a
better understanding of what they are doing. It is recommended that you have NatSpec in

your contracts. More details about it here: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/natspec-
format.html.

**Recommendation:**

Add NatSpec and comments to contract functions and variables. To emphasize the
contract's role, also add NatSpec to the contract description.
