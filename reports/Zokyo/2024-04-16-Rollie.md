### Vulnerability in updatePair Function Allows Creation of Duplicate pairName Entries

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: PairInfos.sol

**Description**

In PairInfos.sol, the `updatePair` function is susceptible to a critical vulnerability that allows for the creation of duplicate `pairName` entries for pairs. This vulnerability arises from the scenario where the function is called with a Pair object containing a `pairName` that matches an existing pair's `pairName`. The vulnerability can lead to inconsistencies in the contract's state that may be challenging to mitigate.

**Scenario**:

Consider the following scenario:
- A `PairInfos` Contract named target is deployed, and pairs are added to it using the `addPairs` function. Among these pairs, there are two pairs with pairName values of "ETHUSDT" and "WBTCUSDT", respectively.
- The `updatePair` function is called with an index of 1 and a Pair object that has its `pairName` set to "ETHUSDT".
- Due to a coding error, the `updatePair` function fails to properly check for duplicate `pairName` entries.
- As a result, the contract allows the creation of a duplicate `pairName` entry for the pair with the `pairName` "ETHUSDT".
- Subsequent operations on the pairs may encounter inconsistencies, as the contract now contains two pairs with the same `pairName` value.
  
**Impact**:

This vulnerability can have severe implications for the integrity and reliability of the smart contract:
- **Inconsistencies in State**: The presence of duplicate `pairName` entries can lead to inconsistencies in the contract's state, making it difficult to determine the correct data associated with each pair.
- **Data Integrity Compromised**: The incorrect data associated with pairs can compromise the integrity of the contract's data, potentially resulting in erroneous calculations or operations.
- **Mitigation Challenges**: Mitigating the effects of this vulnerability may be challenging, as identifying and resolving inconsistencies in the contract's state can be complex and resource-intensive.

**Recommendation** 

**Duplicate Entry Checking**: Enhance the `updatePair` function to include thorough checks for duplicate `pairName` entries before allowing updates to pairs. This ensures that each pair has a unique pairName value.

**Fix** - Issue addressed in commit fdfa146 , by adding this at line 218 
```solidity
require(!isPairListed[_pair.pairName], "PAIR_ALREADY_LISTED");
```
The error message though confuses in case of debugging as it confuses with the error in the line before it “PAIR_NOT_LISTED”.  It is recommended to change the error message to “NAME_ALREADY_USED”.

### `userLastDepositTime` can be enforced without user's consent

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: TradingVault.sol

**Description**

In function `deposit(uint256 _amount, address _user)`, caller can deposit `_amount` of `standardToken` for `_user` and update `userLastDepositTime` for that user. The mapping `userLastDepositTime` limits the user from withdrawing the deposits.
```solidity
userLastDepositTime[user] = block.timestamp;
```
Caller `msg.sender` can deposit dust amounts (i.e. 1 wei) in order to block user from withdrawing which can be considered a denial of service being imposed on that user from doing withdrawal operations.

**Recommendation** 

The following strategies can be implemented to address the issue:

Implementing a minimum deposit requirement can serve as a deterrent to potential attackers.
It is important to carefully select and vet allowed callers, particularly those listed in the allowed mapping (i.e. no code change required). 

**Fix** - Finding is addressed in commit fdfa146 ,  the instruction:   `userLastDepositTime[user] = block.timestamp;`    is only executed when caller is not among the list of privileged allowed depositors.  Therefore the timestamp update can not be imposed on the user. However the list of allowed depositors still require careful vetting to avoid a scenario in which allowed depositor conspires with a user to give advantage to the user to deposit without any time constraint to stay locked in the protocol. 
                    
An important issue arises when the user have no deposit and the allowed depositor is depositing for them for the first time. In this case we have  `userLastDepositTime[_user] = 0;`    which gives a misleading piece of information about the user’s deposit. If rewards are distributed based on the locking time here from another protocol this can be critical.  

In response to the identified issue, the client provided clarification regarding the purpose of the specified timeframe `userLastDepositTime`. They affirmed that this timeframe is not directly associated with rewarding users but rather serves as a mechanism to prevent malicious staking and withdrawal activities. Additionally, the client committed to conducting a comprehensive review of each permission granted for staking, emphasizing the importance of understanding and validating these permissions thoroughly.


### Redundant Calculation of `positionChange` in updateMargin Function

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: Trading.sol

**Description**:

The `updateMargin` function within Trading contract intended for trading operations contains a logical inconsistency that results in the `positionChange` variable always evaluating to zero. This issue arises from the method of recalculating leverage and subsequently calculating `positionChange`. 

The specific lines of code in question are:
```solidity
uint256 position = ot.base.margin * ot.base.leverage;
...
uint256 leverage = position / newMargin;
...
uint positionChange = position / LEV_DENOMINATOR - (newMargin * leverage) / LEV_DENOMINATOR;
```

Given that leverage is recalculated as `position / newMargin`, and position is initially calculated as `ot.base.margin * ot.base.leverage`, the recalculation of position using the new leverage and new Margin essentially reverses the initial calculation, leading to `positionChange` being `zero`. This redundancy does not align with the intended functionality of capturing the change in position due to margin updates.

**Recommendation**:

To address this issue, it is recommended to revise the calculation of `positionChange` to accurately reflect the change in position due to the margin update.

### Potential Denial of Service (DoS) via Unchecked External Calls in `FeeHelper` Contract

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: FeeHelper.sol

**Description**:

The `dealReferralAward` function in the `FeeHelper` contract makes external calls to the referral contract without validating the return values (rebase and discount). This oversight can lead to a situation where the sum of rebase and discount exceeds `totalFee`, resulting in a negative balance calculation. This scenario can potentially lock funds, as the contract attempts to transfer more tokens than available, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition for subsequent operations.

**Recommendation**:

Implement a validation step in the `dealReferralAward` function to check if the sum of rebase and discount exceeds totalFee. If the condition is true, execute an alternative logic path that avoids a DoS scenario. For example:

```solidity
function dealReferralAward(uint256 totalFee, address trader, uint256 position) private returns (uint256 left) {
    if (address(referral) == address(0)) return totalFee;
    (uint256 rebase, uint256 discount) = referral.distributeRefReward(trader, totalFee, position);
    
    // Validate the sum of rebase and discount does not exceed totalFee
    if (rebase + discount > totalFee) {
        // Implement alternative logic here
        // For example, log the incident and continue without transferring funds
        emit ReferralRewardExceedsTotalFee(trader, rebase, discount, totalFee);
        return totalFee;
    }

    if (discount != 0) {
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(standardToken, trader, discount);
    }
    if (rebase != 0) {
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(standardToken, address(referral), rebase);
    }
    left = totalFee - discount - rebase;
}

```
## Low Risk

### Single Point of Failure in Keeper Role

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: PairInfos.sol

**Description**: 

The `setPairParams` function in the `PairInfos` contract is protected by the `onlyKeeper` modifier, allowing only the designated keeper to update critical trading pair parameters. This function's role is crucial for the ongoing maintenance and adjustment of trading parameters to respond to market conditions or protocol needs. The reliance on a single keeper address for such a critical function introduces a single point of failure. If the keeper's private key is lost, there would be no way to update pair parameters, rendering parts of the protocol inoperable. If the key is compromised, an attacker could manipulate trading parameters to their advantage.

**Impact**: 


The single point of failure associated with the keeper role can lead to several adverse outcomes:

- **Operational Risk**: Loss of the keeper's private key would prevent any further updates to pair parameters, potentially freezing aspects of the protocol's operations.
- **Security Risk:** Compromise of the keeper's private key could allow unauthorized manipulation of pair parameters, leading to financial loss for users and the protocol.
- **Redundancy Risk: **Inability to update critical parameters could render the protocol obsolete over time, as it fails to adapt to evolving market conditions or protocol needs.

**Recommendation**:

- **Implement Multi-Signature Mechanism**: Transition from a single keeper to a multi-signature mechanism for critical functions like setPairParams. This would require multiple trusted parties to agree on updates, significantly reducing the risk of key loss or compromise.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Consider implementing a decentralized governance model, allowing token holders to vote on updates to pair parameters. This could enhance security and reduce reliance on a single keeper.

### Redundant Expression in `doneCloseRequst` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: TradingStorage.sol

**Description**: 

The function `doneCloseRequst` contains a redundant expression `exec;` which has no effect on the execution of the function. This expression does not perform any operation or change any state within the function, making it unnecessary and potentially confusing for readers of the code.

**Impact**:

While this issue does not directly affect the contract's security or functionality, it introduces unnecessary clutter and can lead to confusion. It may mislead developers or auditors into thinking that exec has some side effect or is checked later in the function, which is not the case.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the redundant `exec;` expression from the `doneCloseRequst` function. This will have no impact on the function's logic but will improve code clarity and maintainability.

### Local Variable Shadowing in TradingVault & Referrals Contract

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Referrals.sol


**Description**: 

In both the `TradingVault` and `Referrals` contracts, there is an issue with function parameter shadowing that could lead to confusion and potentially incorrect assumptions about the contract's state. Specifically, the parameter `_status` in the `setAllowedToInteract` and `setAllowed` functions shadows the `_status` state variable inherited from the ReentrancyGuard and ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable contracts, respectively. This shadowing can cause confusion regarding which `_status` variable is being referenced and manipulated within the function's scope.

**Affected Functions:**
```solidity
TradingVault.setAllowedToInteract(address,bool)._status
TradingVault.setAllowed(address,bool)._status
Referrals.setAllowedToInteract(address,bool)._status
```

**Recommendation:**

To avoid confusion and ensure clarity in the contract's logic, it is recommended to rename the `_status` parameter in the `setAllowedToInteract` and `setAllowed` functions across both the `TradingVault` and `Referrals` contracts.


### Precision Loss Due to Division Before Multiplication in `closingFee` Calculation

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Trading.sol


**Description**: 

The calculation of `closingFee` within the `_closeTrade` function is susceptible to precision loss due to the order of operations where division occurs before multiplication. This issue stems from the calculation of `closePosition` where `_closeMargin` is divided by `LEV_DENOMINATOR` before being multiplied by `_ot.base.leverage`. This sequence of operations can lead to significant precision loss, especially when dealing with large numbers or small margins, affecting the accuracy of fee calculations and potentially leading to incorrect fee deductions and value transfers.

**Recommendation**:

To mitigate the precision loss, the calculation of `closingFee` should be adjusted to ensure multiplication occurs before division.

### Inconsistent Attribute Validation in Modifiers

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: PairInfos.sol

The smart contract includes four modifiers (`groupListed`, `feeListed`, `groupOk` and `feeOk`) that are responsible for validating attributes related to groups and fees. However, there is inconsistency in how these modifiers handle zero values for certain attributes.
```solidity
   modifier groupListed(uint256 _groupIndex) {
        require(groups[_groupIndex].maxCollateralP > 0, "GROUP_NOT_LISTED");
        _;
    }

    modifier feeListed(uint256 _feeIndex) {
        require(fees[_feeIndex].openFeeP > 0, "FEE_NOT_LISTED");
        _;
    }

    modifier groupOk(Group calldata _group) {
        require(_group.maxCollateralP < MILLAGE_DENOMINATOR, "maxCollateralP wrong");
        _;
    }

    modifier feeOk(Fee calldata _fee) {
        require(_fee.openFeeP < MILLAGE_DENOMINATOR && _fee.closeFeeP < MILLAGE_DENOMINATOR, "WRONG_FEES");
        _;
    }
```
The `groupListed` and `feeListed` modifiers are designed to validate the existence of a group and fee, respectively, by verifying that certain attributes are non-zero. For example, `groupListed` checks if the `maxCollateralP` attribute of the specified group is greater than zero, while `feeListed` checks if the `openFeeP` attribute of the specified fee is greater than zero.
On the other hand, the corresponding modifiers `groupOk` and `feeOk` are intended to ensure that the attributes of a group or fee are within acceptable ranges. However, these modifiers allow zero values for certain attributes. For instance, groupOk permits setting a zero value for the `maxCollateralP` attribute of a group, while `feeOk` allows zero values for both the `openFeeP` and `closeFeeP` attributes of a fee.

**Impact**:

This inconsistency in attribute validation can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities in the smart contract. Allowing zero values for certain attributes without proper validation may result in incorrect or unintended functionality, potentially exposing the contract to manipulation or exploitation by malicious actors.

**Recommendation**

To address this inconsistency and enhance the security of the smart contract, it is recommended to ensure uniform validation of attributes across all modifiers. Specifically:
Consistent Attribute Validation: Review and revise the groupOk and feeOk modifiers to enforce non-zero values for attributes that are crucial for the integrity and functionality of the contract. This ensures consistency with the validation approach used in the `groupListed` and `feeListed` modifiers.

### Potential inconsistent accounting due to `rescueFunds` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**location**: FeeHelper.sol

The smart contract contains a function named `rescueFunds` that allows the owner to withdraw an arbitrary amount of an arbitrary ERC20 token (_token) and transfer it to a specified `_receiver` address. While this functionality provides flexibility for the owner to recover funds, there is a flaw in how it handles withdrawals of the contract's (standardToken).
```solidity
   function rescueFunds(address _token, address _receiver, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(_receiver != address(0));
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(_token), _receiver, _amount);
    }
```
When the owner calls `rescueFunds` with `_token` set to `standardToken`, it triggers a transfer of the token from the contract to the specified `_receive`r address. However, since the contract's accounting is likely based on the `standardToken`, this withdrawal could lead to inconsistencies or incorrect accounting records.

**Recommendation**

**Restrict Standard Token Withdrawals**: Modify the `rescueFunds` function to prevent the withdrawal of (standardToken). This can be achieved by implementing additional checks or by explicitly excluding the token from the list of tokens eligible for withdrawal in `rescueFunds`.

### Collateral limit may prevent the position owner from updating their position and avoiding liquidation

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `updateMargin` function in the Trading contract allows a position owner to either increase or decrease the margin of their open trade. The function retrieves the details of the open trade and performs checks to ensure the caller is the trader of the position and the amount to be added or subtracted is positive. If the margin is being increased, it checks if the new margin would exceed the collateral limit using `pairInfo.isExceedGroupsCollateralLimit`. If not, it transfers the additional amount from the trader.

However, in a rapidly declining market, the value of collateral can decrease quickly. If the collateral value approaches or exceeds the maximum allowed (as per `isExceedGroupsCollateralLimit`), traders who wish to add margin to their positions to avoid liquidation may be unable to do so. If traders cannot add margin to their positions, they face automatic liquidation if the margin falls below the maintenance margin.
The check for exceeding the group's collateral limit is not presented during the opening of a position. This inconsistency might allow positions to be opened that are already close to the collateral limit.

Recommendation: Introduce checks similar to `isExceedGroupsCollateralLimit` during the position opening phase. This ensures that new positions are not opened too close to the collateral limit, thereby reducing the risk of immediate liquidations in volatile markets

### Method `distributeReward` can increment `currentBalance` without sending tokens 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract `TradingVault`, method `distributeReward(...)` has a boolean value to check if `standardToken` needs to be transferred from `msg.sender` or not. 
In case `_send` is false and `StandardToken` is not already transferred, `currentBalance` will be increased by `_amount` which can lead to wrong calculation of shares and assets.

**Recommendation**: Add a check to ensure that `currentBalance`  is equal to amount of Standard tokens in the contract.

### No address(0) check

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract `PythOracle.sol`, the method `rescueFunds()` does not validate if `_receiver` is `address(0)` or not. If accidentally set to `address(0)`, funds would be lost.

In Contract `PairInfos.sol`, the method `initialize(...)` transfers ownership to address `_owner` which is not validated to be `address(0)` or not.

In Contract `Trading.sol`, the method `initialize(...)` transfers ownership to address `_owner` which is not validated to be address(0) or not.

**Recommendation**: Add a check to validate if the given parameter is address(0) or not.

## Informational

### Confusing Function Naming in `_checkTradeType` Function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Trading.sol

In the smart contract, there exists a function named `_checkTradeType` with a misleading name that obscures its intended functionality. Despite its name suggesting a check for trade type consistency, the function's actual purpose is to assert that two trade types are not equal.
```solidity
   function _checkTradeType(TradeType c, TradeType a) private pure {
        require(c != a, "unsupport");
    }
```
The misleading naming of the `_checkTradeType` function can lead to confusion among developers and maintainers of the smart contract. This confusion may result in misinterpretation of the function's intended behavior, leading to errors or unintended consequences.

**Recommendation**

To improve clarity and maintainability of the smart contract code, it is recommended to rename the `_checkTradeType` function to accurately reflect its purpose. A more descriptive name, such as `_assertTradeTypeInequality`, would better convey the function's role in asserting the inequality of trade types.

Additionally, consider adding comments or documentation to the function to provide further context on its intended behavior and usage. Clear and concise naming conventions, coupled with comprehensive documentation, contribute to the readability and understanding of smart contract code.
By adopting clearer naming conventions and providing sufficient documentation, developers can enhance the readability and maintainability of smart contracts, reducing the likelihood of errors and facilitating smoother development and auditing processes.

### Safe maths utilized in for-loop

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: PairInfos.sol

The default safe math operation in solidity versions ^0.8.x incurs extra gas overhead due to it requiring more computation. The following operations in functions (`setPairParams`, `addPairs` and `occupiedCollateral`), that are being carried out on the iterator of the for-loop, can be more gas-efficient by using the unchecked statement.
One example in PairInfos.sol:
```solidity
    function addPairs(Pair[] calldata _pairs) external onlyOwner {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _pairs.length; i++) {
            _addPair(_pairs[i]);
        }
    }       
```
Preferrable to implement it as such:
```solidity
    function addPairs(Pair[] calldata _pairs) external onlyOwner {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _pairs.length;) {
            _addPair(_pairs[i]);
            unchecked { i++; }
        }
    }       
```
**Recommendation** 

Utilize the use of unchecked whenever possible as long as arithmetic safety is ensured within the context of calculation
