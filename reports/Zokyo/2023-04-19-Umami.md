# Findings

## High Risk

### Cast issue for negative value

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract VaultFeeManager, function _getVaultRebalanceFees, the userPositionDelta is cast to uint256. If the userPositionDelta is negative, it will be cast to a very large positive number, and this could lead to unexpected behavior.  The userPositionDelta should be cast to uint256 only if it is positive, otherwise the value of ‘ -userPositionDelta
 should be cast to uint256 .

**Description**: 

If the userPositionDelta is negative, it should be cast to uint256 as follows:
```solidity
            uint256 lockedBalanceSansUserDelta = userPositionDelta > 0
              ? currentBalance - uint256(userPositionDelta)
               : currentBalance + uint256(-userPositionDelta);
```

### First Depositor Issue

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract AssetVault is implementing the standard ERC4626, thanks to their design these types of vaults are subject to a share price manipulation attack that allows an attacker to steal underlying tokens from other depositors (this is a known issue of Solmate's ERC4626 implementation) 

**POC**: 

https://hackmd.io/@T-egO1mKQkWZYwdNtLdSsw/Bk5rkHGRi (example was simplified to be easier to understand)

**Recommendation**: 

In the deposit function of AssetVault, consider requiring a reasonably high minimal amount of assets during first deposit. The amount needs to be high enough to mint many shares to reduce the rounding error and low enough to be affordable to users.

**Note**: 

Umami DAO will seed the vault first and run for days before opening the vault to the whitelist depositors. This will ensure the first depositor vulnerability can be used and allow the vault to run smoothly before user funds are added




### Pricing equation is not functioning properly

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

GlpPricing.sol - In method usdToGlp, the result is divided by 1e24 to adjust units, but the placement of 1e24 in this context ends up having a result of zero for reasonably given usdAmount. Current formula is:
return ((usdAmount) / (glpPrice(maximise))) / 1e24;

**Recommendation** 

In order to match usdToGlp with glpToUsd , we estimate that the equation should be:
return ((usdAmount) * 1e24 / (glpPrice(maximise)));




### Function fail silently while in similar context it reverts

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

SwapLibrary.sol - in _swapTokenExactOutput , the method returns 0 if token balance is zero. While in other context if balance is not enough to fulfill the swap it will revert. In that regard, this method has the potential to fail silently whilst the transaction succeeds, but the output state does not meet the expectation.
What makes this method even more critically severe is the usage of it in swapTokensExactOutput() as it does not validate the return value of method _swapTokenExactOutput. This might lead to loss of funds if the user of the library takes fund transfers decisions based on the success of the method call. Similar comment on _swapTokenExactInput.

**Recommendation** 

According to the usecase , devs can force method to revert or check the return of the private methods and act accordingly.

## Medium Risk


### Using solmate safeTransfer OR safeTransferFrom without code check

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

All the contracts are making heavy use of solmate’s library (e.g. function transferAsset from AggregateVault contract ) the main usecase of this collection is to optimize the gas usage as much as possible, for that to be achieved there have been some compromised made by the library developers. ​​This is a known issue while using solmate's libraries. Hence this may lead to miscalculation of funds and may lead to loss of funds, because if safetransfer() and safetransferfrom() are called on a token address that doesn't have a contract in it, it will always return success, bypassing the return value check. Due to this, the protocol will think that funds have been transferred successfully, and records will be accordingly calculated, but in reality, funds were never transferred. So this will lead to miscalculation and possibly loss of funds

**Recommendation**: 

Use openzeppelin's safeERC20 or implement a code size check

**Note**: All tokens that will be transferred using solmates transfer libs will only be well-defined tokens trading in GLP.


### ChainLink successfull response not implemented correctly

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The ChainLinkWrapper contract is not properly implementing the case where the oracle is responding successfully, this is originating from function _getCurrentChainlinkResponse L#168, the function is not assigning any value to the field success field from structure OracleResponse, this will make the successful call to fail in the check from function _isBadOracleResponse


**Recommendation**: 

Assign the true value for the sucess field from the response struct

More explanations → Untitled document

**Note**: Chainlink wrapper was removed, unused

### Unexpected tokens with fees will break the vault

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract AssetVault is a type of vault that supports only one ERC20 tokens, so for each token there will be a different vault deployed, based on the initial premise there will be quite a lot of tokens supports (e.g WBTC, WETH, USDC, LINK, UNI, etc…) .
And the list may extend in the future. However,  if any of these tokens will start charging fee on transfers (on other blockchains USDT already charge fees on transfers, on Ethereum the logic is already there, but the fee is set as 0), or if you will ever extend the list of vaults with tokens that have fees, the logic will be broken

**Recommendation**: 

To avoid this situation, use a common pattern, where you check the balance between operations.
**Note**: We will remain with the assumption that none of these tokens, nor any GLP tokens potentially added in the future, will have fees on transfer.



### Logic error in whitelist validation

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract AggregateVault, the peripherals are set one by one using the setPeriheral function, one of those peripherals is the Whitelist contract that it is used in the onlyWhitelisted modifier, because the contracts needs to be deployed multiple times and each time it needs to be configured there are big chances of mistakes in repetitive tasks, if the Whitelist contract will not be set, then it’s value will be address(0) and the logic will not enter the second if to break revert the execution, it will simply con	tinue normally.

**Recommendation**: 

Revert the execution if the whitelist contract is the default address.

**Note**: Address(0) set for whitelist contract is assumed to have no whitelist option enabled so the skip is intentional if 0’d


### Unchecked possible zero address

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract UmamiPriceFeed.sol there are multiple cases where input addresses are not checked to not be null/zero. For example, the setGov function sets the gov address, so in case the input address is by accident send as zero address it can lock the contract as the setter has the 'onlyGov' modifier. This also occurs in functions setGmxVaultPriceFeed and setSecondaryPriceFeed.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check for the input addresses to not be null/zero


### Unchecked Chainlink sequencer uptime

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract ChainlinkWrapper there are no checks for the uptime status of the Chainlink L2 sequences. It's recommended that L2 oracles fetch the uptime for the Chainlink sequencer to ensure the data returned can be trusted. This can lead to errors on the L2 chain as the price data is not updated correctly. For a more detailed explanation, check the chainlink docs and code snippet: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds.

**Recommendation**: 

check if the sequencer is active and act on the response accordingly

**Note**: Chainlink wrapper was removed, unused
https://github.com/UmamiDAO/V2-Vaults/commit/4419ae6e85f59ef5c3d711ec0c8f7b942620fe90


### Unchecked transfer result

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract AssetVault in function claimWithdrawalRequest at line 126 the result of the 'asset.transfer' is not checked. The value returned by the transfer function from ERC20 standard should be checked, as implementations differ.

**Recommendation**:

use safeTransfer


### Unreachable code

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract GmxPositionManager, function ‘positionMargin’, has two if conditional statements one after the other that check the same condition. In the first if statement however, if the condition is true, the function will simply return. This will make the code in the second if statement to never be reachable. The intention might be to just return the default values, in this case ‘0’ and ‘true’ and the fix in this case is to remove line 342 entirely.



**Recommendation**: 

Re-write the if statements in a way that there’s no unreachable branch (removing the first ‘if’ seems most natural).






### Decimals mismatched


**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

VaultLifecycle.sol - in method rollover we have this line:


It is noted in the contract that params.decimals refers to the decimals of the asset ERC20. Given that the equation of sharesToAsset is:


These equations show that the result is in decimals of shares ERC20 while it should be in decimals of asset ERC20.
**Example**:
Given asset: usdc with decimals = 6
decimals of shares ERC20 = 18
assetPerShare = 2 usdc/share which is 2*10**6
shares = 10 share which is 10*10**18
result = 10 * 10**18 * 2 * 10**6 / 10**6 = 20 * 10**18
The result given is too much for the usdc decimals, it was expected to be 20 * 10**6 instead. As for pricePerShare, we have a similar situation given by this:


as singleShare = 10**decimals, totalBalance points at asset and totalSupply points at shares. We end up having a formula that does not match the expected result. For method pricePerShare though, the only way to solve this is to assert that asset ERC20 decimals is the same as shares ERC20 decimals. Issue is existing in ShareMath.sol, need to do the following recommendation.


**Recommendation** 

Fix it in VaultLifecycle doc that params.decimals is referring to shares decimals. Also for ShareMath.sol, in pricePerShare adjust the formula to put in consideration decimals of both asset and shares. Like:


where assetUnit = 10**assetDecimals and sharesUnit = 10**sharesDecimals



### Method isTimeout signals a false positive

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TimeoutChecker.sol - Method isTimeout returns true in a specific case (block.timestamp < timestamp). This case contradicts the fact that method signals true when block.timestamp > timestamp by a margin of timeout. This makes it susceptible to false signaling.

**Recommendation** 

Better revert if block.timestamp < timestamp to avoid underflow and false signaling.



### Unsafe casting possibility

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

NettingMath.sol - in vaultExposureInt - casting uint to int is unsafe without validation. The result should be kept positive, as it is originally a multiplication of 2 uint256s (glpHeld * glpComposition[i]).

**Recommendation** 

Suggest the use of a SafeCast library, like this one used here by Quoter on arbiscan 0xb27308f9F90D607463bb33eA1BeBb41C27CE5AB6



### sumColumns not properly looped

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Solarray.sol - In sumColumns(int256[5][4] memory _array), the first for-loop which is supposed to loop on the first dimension of _array through i, is including 4 iterations (i.e. since _array.length returns 4) but it should be going through 5 iterations. The issue arises from assuming that both dimensions of the array are equal and represented as _array.length.

**Recommendation** 

first loop iterations should be 5 not 4. First for-loop limit be replaced by _array[0].length. And return length of array is int256[5] not int256[4].


### Unexpected length of array returned


**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Solarray.sol - In scaleArray - function scaleArray(uint256[4] memory _array, uint256 _scale) internal pure returns (uint256[5] memory _retArray) {

_retArray is of length 5 while it should be 4.

**Recommendation** 

Change return to (uint256[4] memory _retArray).

## Low Risk

### Unchecked possible zero address

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract Auth.sol, inside the constructor the _auth parameter can be zero and is not checked. In case the address is zero, the contract would not function properly and there is no fallback method to set the correct implementation after deployment.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a sanity check for the to address variable to not be zero and revert otherwise.

### Array does not have a fixed length

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract AggregateVaultStorage, struct AvStorage at line 77 there is an array called swapFee, that array will be setted as the same time as the vaults, in function setAssetVaults from AggregateVault contract, and in that function the length of the arrays is checked to be equal, at this moment the assetVaultEntiries have a fixed length of 5 items, however swapFee is not declared from the beginning as a fixed array of 5 items.

**Recommendation**: 

Declare swapFee as a fixed array length of 5 items.


### Variable not used

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract AggregateVault, at line 62, the variable WETH is hardcoded and declared immutable, however, it is not used anywhere in the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the variable.



### Parameter not used

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract AssetVault, at line 117, function requestRebalanceWithdraw, parameter owner it is never used.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the owner parameter.


### Pragma version lock

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

It’s recommended to have the same compiler and flags that the contracts were tested with the most. This way, it reduces the risk of introducing unknown bugs by accidentally deploying with the latest version that might not be stable yet.

**Recommendation**: 

Lock pragma versions




### Config setters not emitting events

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract UmamiPriceFeed.sol in functions setGov, setGmxVaultPriceFeed, setMaxStrictPriceDeviation and setSecondaryPriceFeed there are no events emitted. It’s recommended to emit events when config parameters change, as these can server as a history of changes that occured and also makes the changes observable offchain for subscribed listeners.

**Recommendation**:

Emit events for the corresponding functions


### Unresolved TODO may result in revert

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract GmxPositionManager, function ‘positionMargin’, has an unresolved issue marked with a TODO that may result in an integer underflow, in case the ‘collateral’ is lower than ‘amount’.



**Recommendation**: 

Fix TODO by assuming position may be underwater.



### Approving more amount than the actual transfer


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

SwapLibrary.sol - in _swapTokenExactOutput we have:


Where _assetAmountIn refers to the maximum input amount in the swap operation that is required for slippage. Approving an amount more than actually needed is unsafe, therefore, extra care might be needed by the user of the library to remove the extra allowance that is approved here.

**Recommendation** 

Two ways can help:
Prestimate the amountIn needed exactly by using Quoter contract in arbitrum 0xb27308f9F90D607463bb33eA1BeBb41C27CE5AB6. Here is a code sample on how this can be used:


Override the approval by zero after the swap: 


### Redundancy in data might cause conflict


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

SwapLibrary.sol - in all methods of the library we have swapData and fromAsset. fromAsset is actually part of swapData's path variable. Passing conflicting data (i.e. different fromAsset and path) shall lead to undesireable results.

**Recommendation** 

Extract fromAsset from the path using byte decoding.






### Unsafe casting of array elements


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


Solarray.sol - In intToUintArray, elements of this array are being cast to uint without confirming they are greater than or equal to zero (i.e. within the domain of uint256). Also, similar issue in same contract in method arrayDifference where this int256(_base[i]) considered unsafe casting without a prior validation.

**Recommendation** 

Suggest the usage of a SafeCast library.

## Informational

### Remove unnecessary imports

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In many contracts, the console is imported from “forge-std/console.sol”. Since the console module is primarily used for testing and debugging, it is not necessary or desirable to include it in a production contract. Removing this statement will help keep the codebase clean and efficient, while removing any unnecessary dependencies.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove unnecessary import for console.

### Emission of events omitted 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract VaultFeeManager, the functions handleDeposit, handleWithdraw, handleRebalanceRequest, handleGlpRewards are not emitting any events. Adding events is a good practice that enhances transparency and traceability of the smart contract operations. The event should capture all relevant information such as fees generated and relevant parameters.

**Recommendation**: 

Add events for all of these functions to increase the transparency of the contract.


### Pre-conditions not added

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract AggregateVault, functions openRebalancePeriod and closeRebalancePeriod have no preconditions added and todo comments left to add them.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the todo comments and add the pre-conditions.



### No reason to override 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract AssetVault the hooks beforeWithdraw and afterWithdraw are overridden in the contract, however there is no reason to override the functions as there is no changes in them..

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the unnecessary override.




### Missing non zero address check

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract GmxPositionManager inside the constructor, the input parameters are not checked to be non zero. This can lead to misconfiguration and cause issues later while executing the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Check input addresses to be non zero



### Missing licenses

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Some of the contracts in the project are missing the license identifier, for example, GlpHandler.sol. Most of the contracts that have the license specified use the UNLICENSED identifier, so it's unclear if the ones without a version are intended to have No License (None). Even if that's the case, it's recommended to specify the license.

**Recommendation**: 

Specify licenses for all contracts



### Duplicate code for contract check

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract BaseWrapper.sol the functions isNullableOrContract and isContract perform the inline assembly extcodesize check for an address and assert whether the. This check is duplicated in both functions. Also note that extcodesize returns 0 if it is called from the constructor of a contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Extract the code in a separate function or use Address.isContract from Openzeppelin




### Redundant not null check

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract ChainlinkWrapper.sol in function setFlagContract at line 52 there's a check for the input address to not be null. This check is redundant as the function already uses the modifier 'notNull' which performs the same check.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove line 52

### Redundant comparison for uint param

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


In contract ChainlinkWrapper.sol in function _isBadOracleResponse at line 255 the check verifies whether the _response.answer value is smaller or equal to 0. Given the parameter is of type uint it can never be true for the smaller than case.

**Recommendation**: 

Replace smaller than or equal operator (<=) with equal operator (==)



### Missing function body


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract GlpHandler has a function, ‘mintGlpUsdgAmount’, that has nobody.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement the function or make it private since it is never used externally.


### Refactor function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract GlpHandler, function ‘previewGlpBurn’, has a function signature that states that ‘_amtOut’ will be returned, but in actuality, another value will be.


**Recommendation**: 

Remove ‘_amtOut’ from the function signature and declare it inside the function body.



### Refactor revert statements

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract ChainlinkWrapper contains constructions like shown below that can be replaced with ‘require’ statements.



**Recommendation**: 

Introduce require statements instead of imbricated revert and if statements.


### Refactor function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

Contract GmxPositionManager, function ‘gmxPositionCallback’, has a function that contains an if that checks a condition, has a huge body, and on the else body, it has only a revert instruction.


**Recommendation**: 

Refactor the if to check the ‘!_isExecuted’ and revert to the ‘true’ branch and keep the rest of the body without the extra indentation.


### Unused constant BIPS


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

VaultMath.sol - unused constant BIPS declared in the library.

**Recommendation** 

Better be removed if not needed.


### Redundant implementation of method


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

VaultMath.sol - methods getSlippageAdjustedAmount and checkNettingSlippage are the same implementations.


**Recommendation** 

Use only one and remove the other.


### Iterative multiplication causing unnecessary computation


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

VaultMath.sol - method arraySum(int256[5] memory _array) is computationally inefficient since each element of _array is multiplied by 1e18.


**Recommendation** 

Make the summation without multiplication and multiply sum once outside the for loop after getting the summation done.






### Solidity version in two contracts is not compatible with project


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TimeoutChecker.sol & VaultStorage.sol - Those two contracts' solidity version compilation is locked on 0.8.7 while almost the rest of the project compiles with ^0.8.17. The versions cannot match up since.


**Recommendation** 

This is solved consequently if the project solidity versions of contracts are all fixed on one version.



### Methode does not have an implementation in the body

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

PositionMath.sol -




**Recommendation** 

Remove if unneeded.

### Contract have two pragma declarations

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract UmamiPriceFeed, there are two pragma declarations at the beginning of the file, this fact will make the project impossible to compile in a hardhat environment

**Recommendation** 

Remove the unnecessary pragma declaration.
