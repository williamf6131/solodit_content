### First deposit attack via share price manipulation

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

ERC4626 contracts are subject to a share price manipulation attack that allows an attacker to steal underlying tokens from other depositors.

In Contract GlmRouter.sol, the method `gmTokenDeposit(..)` allows anyone to deposit GM tokens directly into the vault and mint shares.

Consider the following scenario:

- Alice deposited 1e12 gm tokens using the `gmTokenDeposit(...)` method.
- Vault mints 1 wei share for Alice (1e12 gm tokens when converted to USDC will be 1 wei in the manager contract)
- Now Alice inflated the share price by directly transferring the gm tokens to the Vault contract.
- Now the share price is (total assets/ total supply) => (10*1e6)/(1)

- Now let’s say Bob deposits 19*1e18 GM tokens, and Bob gets shares = (19*1e6)/(10*1e6) => 1 share
- Now Alice can redeem her share for (10+19)/2 = 14.5 GM tokens which is more than what she deposited.
- Bob will also get 14.5 GM tokens, way less than what Bob deposited.

**Recommendation**: 

- On the first deposit consider minting a fixed and high amount of shares irrespective of deposited shares to mitigate the rounding issue.
- Consider seeding the pool during deployment in the constructor.
- Consider sending 1000 wei of shares to `address(0)` to significantly increase the attack cost for the attacker. 


### The Keeper Management fee is being calculated wrong

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract GlmVault.sol, the method `keeperManagementFeePreview()` calculates the fee for the keeper in gmTokens.

This method checks if the set interval has passed and calculates the fee as follows:
```solidity
require(timeElapsed >= info.managementFeeInterval, "Not enough time elapsed");
       uint256 usdcAmountFor1Year = (totalAssets() * info.managementFeeBpsFor1Year) / DECIMAL_PRECISION;


       uint256 usdcAmount = (usdcAmountFor1Year * info.managementFeeInterval) / (365 days);
```
Here, the final `usdcAmount` only for the interval instead of the entire time elapsed.

For eg: If `managementFeeInterval` is 1 month (30 days) and `usdcAmountFor1Year` is 1000*1e6, the `usdcAmount` as the fee will be (considering total assets remains same for the year):

Before 1 month: 0
After 1 month: (1000*1e6 * 30 days)/365 days = ~82*1e6
After 2 month: 2 * (1000*1e6 * 30 days)/365 days = ~ 164*1e6
…
And so on.

Currently, if this method is called after 3rd month (i.e. in 4th month), the `usdcAmount` will be ~82*1e6 for that month and no fee will be collected for the first 3 months. 

Similarly, if the fee interval is 2 months and the fee is tried to collect in the 5th month, it should calculate fees for the first 2 intervals i.e. 4 months not just for an interval i.e. 2 months.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the logic to consider the time elapsed since the last fee collected time and calculate the fee accordingly.


### GM tokens were deposited but no shares were minted 

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmManger.sol, the method getGmTokenValueInUSDC() has the following logic:
```solidity
uint256 gmTokenPrice = IGlmPriceReader(glm.priceReader).getMarketTokenPrice(_gmToken);
       uint256 usdcPrice = IGlmPriceReader(glm.priceReader).getTokenPrice(USDC) / 1e18; 
       return ((gmTokenPrice * _amount) * usdcPrice) / 1e30 / 1e18; //return 1e6
```

Here if `_amount` is less than 1e12 (let’s say 1e11), the return will be (1e30*1e11*1e6)/(1e48) = 0 but the `_amount` can be of much lower value and the return will be 0.

So if a user deposited (less than 1e12) GM tokens directly using `gmTokensDeposit()` method and when that GM tokens are converted to USDC value, it will be 0. Since the USDC deposited value is 0, the shares minted for the user are 0 as well. This GM token is already sent to the vault tokens and user lose their GM tokens but get no shares.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check to ensure users don’t deposit GM tokens less than 1e12 as conversion from GM tokens to USDC will make it 0 USDC.

## Medium Risk

### The protocol will lose funds as `startRebalance()` can be called more than once for the same `currentId`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRebalance, the method `startRebalance()` can be called by a `glmKeeper` for the `currentId` and set all the rebalance-related information.

The method will sell all the GM tokens for the sell token address and will wait for the USDC return from GMX to process further with the rebalance logic.

At this point, if the `glmKeeper` calls the `startRebalance()` again, it will use the same `currentId` and fetch a new `rebalanceInfo`, replace the previous rebalance info, and sell GM tokens again.

This will lead to a serious loss of funds for the protocol as there is no check to verify if the currentId has already initiated a rebalancing and `startRebalance()` should wait until it is finished.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check to ensure that `startRebalance` can check if the `currentId` is already being used for a rebalance and if a rebalance is already in progress.


### Method `requestDeposit()` doesn’t consider the real USDC value of the amount

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRouter.sol, the method `requestDeposit(_amount)` allows any user to deposit USDC to mint GLP tokens. 
`_amount` is used to check if deposit % is <5%, >5 & <=20% or >20% of current total assets.

It is to be noted that `_amount` may not represent the real USDC value of the deposit amount since current USDC token price is not considered here.

In case, the USDC price is less than 1$, which happened earlier ($0.8774 in March 2023), it will affect the pool for which token should be deposited, the minted shares, and other unexpected results. 

For eg: the amount 1000*1e6 would be only 877*1e6 in USDC in the above example.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider calculating the USDC value of the deposited amount and then calculate the deposit % and follow accordingly.



### Value `minMarketTokens`, `minLongTokenAmount`, `minShortTokenAmount` Hardcoded to 0

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

There is GMX `ExchangeRouter.createDeposit()` external call made in GmRouter.sol and GlmRebalance.sol contracts.
The value for `minMarketTokens` in Router and Rebalance contract is hardcoded to 0, the index token for the market could change in price and alter the price of the market token, making the market token price change unexpectedly causing the vault to receive fewer market tokens than expected.

Also, any deposits/orders that might get executed by the keeper before the deposit may affect the balance of long/short backing tokens in the market and result in more negative impact than expected causing the vault to receive fewer market tokens than expected.
Similarly, in `ExchangeRouter.createWithdrawal(...)`, `minLongTokenAmount` and `minShortTokenAmount` are set to 0.
This leaves withdrawals vulnerable to slippage, especially since withdrawal requests are not executed instantly, but reliant on GMX’s keepers to execute the request.
The market’s state might change significantly between the time the withdrawal request was created and the time GMX’s keepers execute the withdrawal, potentially causing the amount of tokens received to be much smaller than expected and resulting in a loss of funds. 

**Recommendation**: 

Set the `minMarketTokens` to a correct/safe value throughout the codebase. Consider not leaving `minLongTokenAmount` and `minShortTokenAmount` as 0. A possible approach would be to fetch the output amount of long and short tokens with `Reader.getWithdrawalAmountOut()` and use those values as the minimum amounts after factoring in slippage.


### Method `requestWithdrawal` can fail if GMX reverts the txn

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRouter.sol, the method `requestWithdrawal(...)` checks if the `glmAmount` being withdrawn is > `allPoolSplitingBps`. If that is the case, then tokens are withdrawn from all GM pools based on the current weight ratio.

There could be a scenario where all of the assets are in only BTC/ETH pool or at least one of the market pools has a current weight of 0 i.e. no assets deposited for that GM pool.

In that case, the amount to withdraw from GMX for that GM pool will be 0 as well. But the contract doesn’t validate it.
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < poolLength; i++) {
               uint256 amount = ((manager.getCurrentWeight(i, totalAssets) * _glmAmount)) / DECIMAL_PRECISION; //if it is the last pool, withdraw the remaining glm amount
               if (i == poolLength - 1) {
                   keys[i] = _processWithdrawal(remainingGlmAmount, manager.getGmTokenAddress(i), glmPrice);                } else {
                   keys[i] = _processWithdrawal(amount, manager.getGmTokenAddress(i), glmPrice);
                   remainingGlmAmount -= amount;
               }
           }
```

It creates the GMX transactions and sends it along with the fee and this txn will be reverted as the amount is 0.

This will lead to the withdrawal txn being reverted for users.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider adding a check to ensure that the GLM amount withdrawn for any pool is not 0.


### Management Fee Timing Attack

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**: 

The `keeperManagementFeeClaim` function allows the keeper to claim management fees based on the interval set in the contract. However, this function calculates fees based on the total assets at the moment of execution without considering the average or the fluctuation of assets over time. Malicious keepers could exploit this by manipulating the total assets (e.g., by temporarily increasing them) right before claiming fees, leading to unfairly high fees.

**Scenario**: 

Assume the keeper knows when they are going to claim the fees. They could increase the total assets under management by adding assets to the contract shortly before executing the `keeperManagementFeeClaim` function and remove them right after. This manipulation inflates the management fee unjustifiably.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a mechanism to calculate fees based on the average total assets over the fee interval, rather than the total assets at a single point in time. This could involve tracking asset balances at regular intervals and using these to calculate an average.


### The vault contract is not compliant with the ERC4626

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract GlmVault is inheriting from the ERC4626 implementation and overriding several methods. 

GlmVault has overridden the method `deposit()` and `mint()` method but `maxDeposit()` and `maxMint()` are not overridden.

This implies that when `mint()` is called it reverts but `maxMint()` returns `uint(256).max` which is misleading.

Similarly, the deposit method can be paused but `maxDeposit()` still returns `uint(256).max` which is misleading.

Adding to that, `withdraw()` is overridden as well, and any call to `withdraw()` reverts but `maxWithdraw()` returns an uint256 value.

In case these values are read internally or externally will provide incorrect information especially if they are integrated with other smart contracts.

**Recommendations**: 

Update the contract to override the suggested methods to return appropriate values as per the contract state to not return any misleading values.


### `CallbackGasLimit` Should Not Be Hardcoded 

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

`Keys.MAX_CALLBACK_GAS_LIMIT` is configurable param inside GMX protocol, which can be changed to value that is smaller than 2 millions. 
Vaultka creates `createDeposit` and `createWithdrawal` on the GMX side and sends `CallbackGasLimit` alongside the call which is hardcoded to 2 million.When deposit or withdraw request is handled on GMX side, then `callbackGasLimit` is validated to be not bigger than it's allowed. `Keys.MAX_CALLBACK_GAS_LIMIT` value is configurable and can be changed by GMX team. And in case if it will be less than 2 million, then all deposits and withdraws requests from vaultka will be reverted.

**Remediation**:

Make `callbackGasLimit` to be configurable.




### Inaccurate Fee Accrual When Fee Params Are Set To New Values

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

The owner can update the Management Fee Info with the `setManagementFeeInfo` function in the GlmVault.sol . 
However, the current implementation does not account for accrued fees before the update, potentially leading to incorrect fee calculation.
Keeper fee might have been pending for the last set of management fee params and needs to be claimed before new params are set , else fee not accrued is lost forever.

**Recommendation**:

Call the `keeperManagementFeeClaim()` before updating the management fee params.



### `calculateSwapImpactFee` Will Give Incorrect Result For An Edge Case

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

The function `calculateSwapImpactFee` inside GlmVault.sol calculates the swap fee for a swap . A user directly interacting with this function (or a protocol that might integrate with vaultka reading from this function) when provides a token (input or output) that is not in the `gmPools` array returns 0 (this is because function calls `getPoolIdByMarketToken` which will return 0 if token does not exist in array) . This will return 0 as the pool ID (input or output) and since 0 pool ID refers to the first pool the function will return the result for the incorrect pool.

**Recommendation**:

Add a check `isPoolGmToken` for both the tokens (already exists in the function `gmTokenSwap`)



### Incorrect Cast Of GMToken Price

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Resolved

The market token price returned by the price reader (used in manager and other GM contracts) is directly casted to a uint256 (L143) , 
According to GMX  , although unlikely , it is possible for a market token to have negative price. Therefore , casting directly to a uint256 is dangerous as the price in that case would be returned as a extremely large value when price is negative and all the calculations would be incorrect.

**Recommendation**:

If the price is negative consider returning 0.

## Low Risk

### Rebalance will fail if either ETH or BTC pools’ current weight is 0

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRebalance, the method `startRebalance()` calls `getLatestRebalInfo()` which further calls `isCorePoolInRatioInRange()` which checks if the BTC/ETH pools ratio is higher than the upperRation/lowerRation or not.

The method `isCorePoolInRatioInRange()` uses the following logic:
```solidity
 uint256 ratio = btcPoolWeight > ethPoolWeight
           ? (btcPoolWeight * DECIMAL_PRECISION) / ethPoolWeight            : (ethPoolWeight * DECIMAL_PRECISION) / btcPoolWeight;
```
Here it doesn’t check if either btcPoolWeight or ethPoolWeight is equal to 0. If that is the case, the transaction will be reverted due to division by 0 panic error leading to Rebalance failure as well.

Rebalance failing due to this can bring instability to the protocol as the only other way to balance the weight is through deposit which will depend on users.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider adding a check to make sure neither of the weights is 0 and if they are then proceed accordingly without any unexpected failure.


### Possible DoS attack on Rebalance

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRebalance.sol, the method `startRebalance(...)` rebalances the Vaults’ assets as per the configured weights of the assets. 

Since rebalance checks only 2 conditions before considering if the rebalance is valid or not. It’s valid if:
BTC and ETH pools’  total weight is less than the corePoolThreshold
BTC/ETH pool ratio is in the range of 0.3 to 0.7

Any malicious user can see this rebalance transaction in the pool and front-run this transaction to deposit BTC/ETH GM tokens directly in the Vault using `gmTokensDeposit()` method without any deposit fee. This deposit will be to fail both of the above conditions.

This will lead to the actual rebalance transaction being reverted because currently, all conditions will be satisfied.

Soon after the attacker can back-run this transaction withdrawing all deposited GM tokens in USDC as there is no limit and fee on using `requestWithdrawal(...)` method.

This way an attacker can revert the rebalance transaction as long as possible and misuse the unstable state of the protocol which will not be rebalanced.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider adding a withdrawal fee even when the withdrawal amount is in USDC. This will demotivate the attackers to perform this attack.


### The total target weight of all pools should always be 1e30 (100%)

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

In the contract GlmManager.sol, there are several methods that set/modify the target weights of pools. The total of these target weights of pools should always be 1e30 which is not validated for any of the following methods:

`addGmPool(...)`
`setGmPool(...)`
`setGmPoolTargetWeight(...)`
`removeGmPool(...)`

All of the above methods can potentially update the target weight of the pools leading to total target weights to be less or equal or more than 1e30 i.e. 100%. If the total weight is not 100%, it will affect the deposit/withdrawal process.

For eg: A deposit of amount >= 20% distributed across all the pools based on the target weight can lead to loss of funds if the total target is not 100%.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider adding checks to always ensure the total target weight across all pools is exactly 1e30.


### The router can be unpaused by the Owner when paused by manager/callback contracts

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract GlmRouter.sol, the method `setPause(...)` can be accessed by manager callback, rebalance, and rebalance callback contracts to pause the deposit/withdraw.  But it can also be paused/unpaused by the owner, which is an EOA.

Pausing deposit/withdraw also pauses the Swap method in Vault. 

Also, `rebalance()` pauses the deposit/withdrawal unless rebalance is completed.

In case, the owner unpauses the contract in the above cases, for eg. unpauses it in the middle of a rebalance, it will lead to unexpected results for the protocol. 

**Recommendation**: 

Ensure that the protocol does not get unpaused by an EOA during a rebalance or in other cases where the protocol needs to be paused. Consider using a multi-signature wallet for the Owner. 

### GlmRouter’s `calculateGlmPrice()` may not return correct value

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRouter.sol, the method `calculateGlmPrice(...)` does not check if `totalAssets` or `totalSupply` is greater than 0 or not. If total supply is 0, then this method will revert with a divide by 0 error. If total assets are 0, then the returned glm price will be 0.

**Recommendation**: 

update this method to return proper values.

### Hardcoded index values for BTC and ETH can be problematic

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Across the protocol, several methods use 0 as the index for the ETH pool and 1 as the index for the BTC pool.

GlmManager.sol contract allows to deletion/removal of a pool using the following logic:
```solidity
       address marketToken = gmPools[_index].marketToken;
       gmPools[_index] = gmPools[gmPools.length - 1];
       gmPools.pop();
       delete marketTokenToGmPoolInfo[marketToken];
```
Here, the deleted pool index is replaced by the last index pool details. 

If mistakenly, the index 0 or 1 is deleted and replaced by any other pool details, all the hardcoded indices as 0 or 1 will get wrong values which will put the protocol in an unexpected state.

**Recommendations**: 

Consider updating the `removeGmPool(...)` method to not delete a pool if the GM tokens for that pool are present in the vault. Also, add checks to ensure that the ETH or BTC pool is not deleted. It is also advised to not use hardcoded values as indices for these pools rather use a method to fetch the pools.


### Use `.call{}()` over transfer/send for transferring native token

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In GlmRouter and GlmRebalance contract, there are several instances (sending remaining execution fee to the user, `receive()` method logic) where native tokens are sent to the user using `.transfer()` method.

It is not advised to use `send()/transfer()` since these methods get exact gas amounts for executions and changes in gas cost will make them revert.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to use `.call()` for sending native tokens with proper reentrancy check as well.


### Withdraw (in USDC) without any fees can motivate users to withdraw high amounts

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract GlmRouter.sol, there are no withdrawal limit and fee restrictions on users using the method `requestWithdrawal()`.
Users can always redeem their GLM shares to withdraw in USDC without paying any fees and can withdraw a large amount as well. 
This will impact the stability of the protocol as pools can get below minimum weight as there are no checks to ensure that.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a withdrawal fee or withdrawal limit for the `requestWithdrawal()` method as well.


### Rebalance might not work for pools with less than minimum weight assets ratio 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRebalance, the method `getLatestRebalInfo(...)` has one return variable `bool isValidRebalance`.

This value is set as following:
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < manager.getGmPoolLength(); i++) {
          …
           if (currentWeight < minimumWeight) {               isValidRebalance = true;
           }
       }
       isCorePoolLowerThanThreshold(totalAssets) || isCorePoolsRatioInRange(totalAssets)
           ? isValidRebalance = true
           : isValidRebalance = false;
```
Here, if any pool’s current weight is less than minimum weight then that pool is considered to be rebalanced. But at the end of the function, the condition to rebalance is set to be true and only if BTC and ETH pools’ total weight is less than 70% or BTC pool weight / ETH pool weight ratio is greater than UpperRatio/LowerRatio.
This makes pools that are currently under minimum weight inconsiderate for rebalancing if BTC/ETH conditions are not met.
For eg: ARB/USDC can have less than 20% weight of total assets and not be considered for rebalancing because BTC + ETH satisfy the conditions.


**Recommendation**:

Consider updating the rebalance logic to rebalance pools with less than the minimum weight assets ratio.

### Update in BTC/ETH pools’ target weight can disrupt rebalancing logic

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Since pools’ target weight can be updated using `setPoolTargetWeight(...)` method, there exists a threat that can disrupt the current rebalancing logic.

If BTC and ETH pools’ total weight is less than 50%, the following check in the rebalancing logic will always be true.
```solidity
function isCorePoolLowerThanThreshold(uint256 totalAssets) public view returns (bool) {
       IGlmManager manager = IGlmManager(glm.manager);
       uint256 corePoolWeight = manager.getCurrentWeight(0, totalAssets) + manager.getCurrentWeight(1, totalAssets);
       return corePoolWeight < corePoolThreshold ? true : false;
   }
```
It is possible because corePoolThreshold can have a minimum value of 50%. 
```solidity
require(
           _corePoolThreshold < DECIMAL_PRECISION && _corePoolThreshold > DECIMAL_PRECISION / 2,
           "corePoolThreshold must be greater than 0 and more than 50% "
       );
```
If both conditions are satisfied together, then rebalacing will always be true and will happen every time irrespective of any other pool conditions.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the pool target weight considering this case.


### Rebalance will revert if `sellCount` is 0

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRebalance.sol, the method `startRebalance(...)` sets the length for the return array paramter `sellGMTokenAddresses` as following:
```solidity
sellGmTokenAddresses = new address[](sellCount);
```
And later on assign values as following:
```solidity
               sellGmTokenAddresses[index] = gmTokens[i];
```
Although it will be unlikely for `sellCount` to be 0, but in case it is, it will revert the rebalance transaction. 

**Recommendation**: 

Consider adding a check to ensure `sellCount` is greater than 0 and if not, proceed accordingly.



### Possibility of Rebalacing execution fee being unused and stuck in the contract

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the GlmRebalnce contract, the method `_keeperTokenPurchases(...)` checks if sufficient `msg.value` for the execution of all token purchases using the following check:
```solidity
       require(msg.value >= usdcAmounts.length * executionFee, "Invalid input"); 
```
Here, when the loops start there is one more check:
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < marketTokens.length; i++) {
           if (usdcAmounts[i] == 0) {
               continue;
           }
… }
```
Meaning that for any `usdcAMount` which is 0, there will be no GMX `createDeposit` transaction which leads to no use of provided `executionFee`.

This means the execution fee is stuck in the contract for later to be used in the next rebalance or sent to the glmKeeper when the `receive()` method is called.

**Recommendation**: 

Send back the unused exectionFee to the keeper when all GMX deposits are done.

### Unnecessary access to `deposit()` method

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

In Contract GlmVault.sol, the method `deposit(...)` can be called by any of the GLM contracts such as Manager, Router, Rebalance or any of the callbacks contracts. While it might be needed later, currently only the Manager and ManagerCallback contracts call the `deposit(...)` method.

Since this method is used to mint shares directly, making it less accessible to other contracts will be advised.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider adding a modifier to allow only the `Manager` and `ManagerCallback` contract currently to access the `deposit()` method.



### Vault can receive ETH but no withdraw method

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

Since the GlmVault.sol contract has a `receive()` method which does allow anyone to send ETH to the vault contract but there is no other method to withdraw or utilize this ETH making this ETH stuck in the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the `receive()` method to send ETH to a proper address or consider adding a method to withdraw the ETH sent to the vault contract.

### Missing validation in the `addGmPool()` method

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

In the contract GlmManager.sol, the method `addGmPool()` allows the owner to set the pool info but without the following checks:
```solidity
 require(_targetWeight <= DECIMAL_PRECISION, "Target weight is too high"); 
       require(_targetWeight >= gmPools[_index].minimumWeight, "Target weight is too low");
       require(_targetWeight >= 1e28 && _minimumWeight >= 1e28, "weight has to be >1%");
```
This means Owner can bypass this checks when adding a pool but this seems to be important as `targetWeight` for a pool getting set more than `minimumWeight` can affect deposit/withdrawal process.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider adding these checks in `addPool()` as well.



### Rebalance considers 4 Gm tokens while Router considers 5 Gm tokens

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

Contract GlmRebalance considers a total of 4 Gm tokens in the rebalancing logic while Contract GlmRouter considers 5 Gm tokens for the deposit/withdrawal process.

Currently, only 4 Gm tokens are used but later if this needs to be increased to 5, a new rebalance contract working with 5 Gm tokens needs to be deployed.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider updating the rebalance contract to work with 5 GM tokens.


### Incorrect Pool Id 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmManager.sol, the method `getPoolIdByMarketToken(...)` will return 0 by default if no matching pool with the given Market token is found.

Since index 0 corresponds to the ETH pool, this will lead to unexpected results.

**Recommendation**: 

Revert if no matching market token pool is found.

### Precision loss due to division before multiplication

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmManger.sol, the method `getGmTokenValueInUSDC()` has the following logic:
```solidity
uint256 gmTokenPrice = IGlmPriceReader(glm.priceReader).getMarketTokenPrice(_gmToken);
       uint256 usdcPrice = IGlmPriceReader(glm.priceReader).getTokenPrice(USDC) / 1e18; 
       return ((gmTokenPrice * _amount) * usdcPrice) / 1e30 / 1e18; //return 1e6
```
Here `usdcPrice` is divided by 1e18 before multiplication with (`gmTokenPrice * amount`).

Similarly, the method `getGmTokenAmountFromUSDC` has the following logic:
```solidity
uint256 gmTokenPrice = IGlmPriceReader(glm.priceReader).getMarketTokenPrice(_gmToken);


       uint256 usdcPrice = IGlmPriceReader(glm.priceReader).getTokenPrice(USDC) / 1e18; 
       return (_usdcAmount * 1e30 * usdcPrice * 1e6) / gmTokenPrice;
```
Here again `usdcPrice` is divided by 1e18 before multiplication with (usdcAmount * 1e30).

Similarly, the method `keeperManagerFeePreview()` has the following logic:

```solidity
  uint256 usdcAmountFor1Year = (totalAssets() * info.managementFeeBpsFor1Year) / DECIMAL_PRECISION;


       uint256 usdcAmount = (usdcAmountFor1Year * info.managementFeeInterval) / (365 days);
```
Here also, `usdcAmountFor1Year` is divided by `DECIMAL_PRECISION` before multiplication with `managementFeeInterval`.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider updating the above calculation by doing multiplication before division.

### Lack of Validation in `SetGlmAddress`

**Severity** : Low

**Status** : Resolved

**Description**:

In GLMVult.sol `setGlmAddresses()` function allows the owner to update critical contract addresses without validation checks. Malicious or erroneous updates could redirect funds, disable functionality, or expose the contract to attacks.

**Recommendation**:

Implement strict validation checks for address inputs in `setGlmAddresses()`. Ensure that addresses are not zero, contracts are correctly configured, and changes are logged for transparency.

### < Instead Of <=

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

According to vaultka docs when depositing (USDC deposits), if the deposit size is less than 5% ( < 5%) then the most underweighted pool is minted . But inside GlmRouter.sol’s requestDeposit() function (L309) the comparison made is “mint the most underweighted pool if the deposit size is <= 5%” , while it should have been < 5% . Due to this users would be minted the most underweighted pool whereas they should have been minted either ETH or  BTC pool if they deposited exactly 5%.

**Remediation**:

Change the condition to `if ((_amount * MAX_BPS) / totalAssets < depositThresholds.splittingBps) {`

## Informational

### GlmKeeper can call `finalizeRebalance()` for a `currentId` which is not initiated

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRebalance.sol, the method `finalizeRebalance()` can be called for any currentId even if it’s not started using `startRebalance()` method.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider adding a check to ensure a rebalance with a particular currentId has been initiated. Also, consider adding checks in `_keeperTokenPurchases(...)` to ensure that the `tokenPurchaseAddresses` and `tokenPurchaseAmounts` are not empty arrays.


### The callback address is set to `address(0)`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

In Contract GlmRebalnce, the method `_keeperTokenPurchaseUsingLongToken(...)` calls GMX `createDeposit(...)` with `callbackContract` set as `address(0)`.

Although it will not revert, GMX deposit guidelines suggest handling the callback properly.

**Recommendation**: Add a proper callback contract address that handles the callback as per GMX guidelines.

### `GetMostOverWeighted` and `GetMostUnderWeighted` defaults to 0

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract GlmManager.sol, the method `getMostOverWeighted()` and `getMostUnderWeighted()` will return a default value of 0 if all pools are at their target weight.

This means that by default ETH will be the over-weighted and under-weighted pool in case all pools’ current weight is equal to their target weight. 

This can make the ETH pool over-weighted if there is a deposit of deposit amount < 5 % of total assets and/or it can make the ETH pool under-weighted if there is a withdrawal of GLM amount < 5% of total supply.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider updating the logic to which pool to deposit if this scenario is unwanted otherwise it can be left as it is after being acknowledged.

### Unused params

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract GlmRouter.sol, the method `requestWithdraw(...)` has a parameter `address _ token` which is not used. It’s been if it’s USDC token or not but that is irrelevant to the method.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider checking if this parameter is needed or not. If not, consider removing it.

### Incorrect method name

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRebalance.sol, the method `isCorePoolsRatioInRange` should be named as `isCorePoolRatioNotInRange` and the return value should be `isNotInRange`.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the method name and return variable name.

### Typos/Incorrect comment/Natspec comments

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract GlmRouter.sol, l#431, there is a typo of Rotuer.
In Contract GlmRebalance.sol, l#22, l#406, l#424, l#362, l#355 has typos.
In Contract GlmVault.sol, l#239 has an incomplete require statement.

### Save gas using Bitwise shift right/shift left operator

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Across the protocol (GlmRebalnce.sol, GlmRouter.sol), there are several mathematical divisions and multiplication by 2. To save some gas, the same can be replaced with proper bitwise shift operators.

**Recommendation**:

Use bitwise shift right/shift left for division and multiplication by 2.

### Use safecast

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract GlmRebalance, in the method `getLatestRebalInfo(...)` casts `uint256(totalAssets)` to `int256(totalAssets)` without the following check:
```solidity
       require(value <= uint256(type(int256).max), "SafeCast: value doesn't fit in an int256");
```
**Recommendation**: 

Use safe cast.

### No fixed solidity version

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Audited contracts use the following floating pragma:
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
It allows to compile contracts with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**:

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.
