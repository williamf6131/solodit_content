# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Smart contracts are using outdated Solidity compiler versions (0.5.16, 0.6.6).

**Recommendation**:

Use up-to-date Solidity compiler version for all contracts.

### NUS.sol, NUS_WETH.sol, REWARDSFACTORY.sol are not referring to specific Solidity compiler version.

**Recommendation**:

Stick to the specific Solidity compiler version.

### StakingRewards.sol is a complete copy of the StakingRewards contract located at StakingRewardFactory.sol, and is not utilized by end product as StakingRewards has to be created by StakingRewardsFactory.

**Recommendation**:

Remove StakingRewards.sol

## Informational

### File NimbisFactory.sol has an incorrect name.

**Recommendation**:

Rename file to NimbusFactory.sol

### Complicated dependency management, Solidity files contain all dependencies required for specific Contract.

**Recommendation**:

Split FACTORY.sol, ROUTER.sol, NUS.sol, NUS_WETH.sol, REWARDSFACTORY.sol to have one
contract per Solidity file.

### NUS.sol, Code-style issue, method tokensBurner has incorrect name as it is not clearly states the goal of method.

**Recommendation**:

Rename method to reflect behaviour, like burnTokensByBurner or burnOwnerTokensByBurner

### NUS_WETH.sol, Code-style issue, Owned & NUS_WETH contracts are having unexpected property names: NUSITERATOR, SWAPROUTER, NUSTOKEN, NUSWETH.

**Recommendation**:

Use camel case for all properties that are not constants.
