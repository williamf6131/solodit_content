# Findings

## High Risk

### The method `multiTransfer(...)` fails to transfer tokens to recipients

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract DevvE.sol, the method multiTransfer(...) fails to transfer tokens to recipients due to the following line:
```solidity
           transferFrom(msg.sender, recipients[i], amounts[i]);
 ```
Here even if `msg.sender` has approved the DevvE contract to transfer tokens on behalf of the `msg.sender` using the approve(...) method although this reverts as using transferFrom(...) directly makes the spender and owner as the `msg.sender` itself.

**Recommendation**: 
Modify the transferFrom(...) method as below:
```solidity
           this.transferFrom(msg.sender, recipients[i], amounts[i]); 
```

## Medium Risk

### DevvE_V2 can not be deployed using `upgradeProxy()`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract DevvE_V2.sol, the constructor is disabling the initializer method without adding the following unsafe check which will not allow this contract to be deployed using upgradeProxy() from the OpenZeppelin’s Hardhat plugin.

**Recommendation**: 

Add the following comment to the constructor to upgrade without any issue.

```solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
   constructor() {
       _disableInitializers(); 
   }
```

## Low Risk

### Centralization risk as minter accounts can mint 50% tokens to themselves

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract DevvE.sol, the methods mint(...) and multiMint(...) allow FOREVVER_MINTER and DEVVIO_MINTER to mint 50% of the total tokens.

This brings centralization risk to the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to use multi-sig accounts for the minter accounts.

### The minted amount can be 0 using the `mint(...)` method

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract DevvE.sol, the method mint(...) does not validate if the amount of tokens to mint is 0 or not. 

**Recommendation**: 

Add a check to ensure users don’t mint 0 tokens and waste gas fees.


### Centralization risk as accounts with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and `MINTER_ROLE` can mint all tokens

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract DevvE.sol has a method mint(...) which allows any account with DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE and MINTER_ROLE to mint all tokens and leave none for other minters. This brings centralization in the minting logic.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to use a multi-sig account for `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.


### Reminting burned tokens breaks the protocol’s assumption

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**


The DevvEV2 contract has set a `GLOBAL_LIMIT` of 300 million for the amount of tokens to be minted. As it also derives from ERC20Burnable, when the burn function is called, it decreases the `totalSupply`. For example, if 100 tokens are initially minted and later 20 of these tokens are burned, the totalSupply is reduced to 80. If another 20 tokens are minted thereafter, the new totalSupply becomes 100 again. This situation poses a conflict with the protocol's initial assumption that the total supply of minted tokens should always be capped at GLOBAL_LIMIT.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the ERC20Burnable inheritance.

## Informational

### Require statements without reasons

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract DevvE.sol, the method multiTransfer(...) has requirement statements without any reason string. 
```solidity
   require(recipients.length > 0);        
   require(recipients.length == amounts.length); 
   require(amounts[i] > 0);
```

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to add reason to the `require` statements.

### Repetitive condition check

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In Contract DevvE.sol, the method multiMint(...) checks for the following conditions which are again verified in the mint(...) method.
```solidity
require(
           totalSupply() + totalAmount <= GLOBAL_LIMIT,
           "Minting this amount would exceed the global limit"
       );
       require(
           _mintedAmount[msg.sender] + totalAmount <= _minterLimit[msg.sender], 
           "Mint amount exceeds the caller's minting limit"
       );
```
**Recommendation**: 

Remove the repetitive conditions checks for saving gas.


### Minters can front-run `setMinterLimit` to mint more tokens

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract DevvE.sol, the method `setMinterLimit(...)` allows the admin to lower the minting limit for any minters. A minter can see this transaction in the pool and front-run this transaction to mint all the available limits.

For ex.
Admin set minter limit for Minter A => 100 tokens
Later, the Admin decides to lower the limit to => 50 tokens
Minter A front run this transaction to mint 100 tokens.
Of course, Minter A can not mint any more tokens when the limit has been set to 50 and already 100 tokens have been minted.

This is unavoidable, but measures can be taken to limit the attack.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to use multi-sig accounts for MINTER_ROLE.


### Missing disable initializer

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Contract DevvE.sol inherits the Intializable.sol and implements the initialize(...) method with the initializer modifier without disabling the initializers for the implementation contract as recommended by OpenZeppelin here.

**Recommendation**: 

Disable the initializers for the implementation method as suggested by OpenZeppelin here.



### Unused constant variables

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract Devve.sol, there are constant variables that are not used and can be removed.
```solidity
   uint256 public constant FOREVVER_LIMIT = 150_000_000; // @audit no use

   uint256 public constant DEVVIO_LIMIT = 150_000_000; // @audit no use
```


**Recommendation**: 

Remove unused variables.

**Fix**: CONTRACT_ADMIN is till unused.

### Floating pragma

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


Audited contracts use the following floating pragma:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.10;
```
It allows to compile contracts with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.
