# Findings

## High Risk

### Signature can be reused unlimited number of times

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Airdrop.sol

**Description**

The signature can be reused by a user to claim the airdrop again and again for unlimited number of times every week. If users who do not claim their airdrop, it could result in other users claiming reward meant for them. Moreover there is no upper limit to the number of times the users can claim the airdrop. 
For example, let's say there is 20000 USDT rewards in the locker. And 10,000 is meant for Bob and Alice each. Then Bob claims 10000 in the 1st week while Alice does not claim any. Alice tries to claim it after 10 days, but when she tries to claim it, she is unable to claim any. This is because Bob had already claimed it second time again on day 8 by reusing his previous signature.

Here is an example test for the same:
```js
     // tokens meant for Aliceis claimed by Bob by reusing previous signature
       await airdropZap
       .connect(Bob)
       .claimRewards(
         1,
         chapterIds,
         erc20RewardsForMultipleChapter,
         ownerSignature,
       );


      expect(await erc20Token.balanceOf(addr7.address)).to.equal(10000);


await time.increase(3600*24*7);
     await airdropZap
     .connect(Bob)
     .claimRewards(
       1,
       chapterIds,
       erc20RewardsForMultipleChapter,
       ownerSignature,
     );


   expect(await erc20Token.balanceOf(addr7.address)).to.equal(20000);
```

**Recommendation**:

It is advised:
1) To keep a max limit check on the number of times the user can claim the airdrop. Ideally it is advised to disallow reusing of old signature by the same user to reclaim the airdrops again and again.
2) It is advised to keep track of the signatures being used by using a nonce and storing the signatures implemented and disallowing its usage again.

### Funds are stuck in new Locker if Locker address is changed for an already existing airdrop

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Airdrop.sol and AirdropFactory.sol

**Description**

If for an already created airdrop, if the locker address is changed in the factory contract, and then new chapters are created based on the new locker, then any funds transferred to the new locker will not be claimable via the `claimRewards()` function of the `Airdrop.sol`. This is because the locker address when changed, gets updated only in the `AirdropList` of the `AirdropFactory.sol` contract. But it is not being updated in the `parentAirdropData` of the `Airdrop.sol` contract. 
 
**Recommendation**

It is advised to

1) Update the locker address corresponding to the airdrop and its chapters in the Airdrop too vis a vis `AirdropFactory.sol`
2) It must also be noted that the previous lockers should not be overwritten so as to its funds are rendered unclaimable by the users. This could result in DoS if locker addresses are overwritten. It is advised to store the locker address for the same and allow claiming of old locker’s funds if isClaimable for it is true. 

## Medium Risk

### The owner of the `AirdropFactory` contract can withdraw all the funds from the locker

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: AirdropFactory.sol

**Description**

The owner of the `AirdropFactory` contract can withdraw all the tokens from the lockers that are created using the `createAirdropProject()` function. This is because the ownership of all the lockers created is transferred to the owner of the `AirdropFactory` contract and can result in rugpull or stealing of all airdrop funds if owners of the contract are malicious.
Similarly, for the process of claiming the tokens for airdrop, it is also possible that the owner of the contract creates signatures allowing the owner himself to claim the airdrop of any amount. 

Here is an example test for the above scenario:
```js
 describe('removeAllAirdropFundsByOwner', function () {
   it('Owner trying to take all aridrop funds by himself', async function () {
     const OwnerofLocker = await locker.owner();
     expect(OwnerofLocker).to.equal(owner);
     await locker.connect(owner).transferERC20(erc20Token.target, 40000, owner);
     console.log("Balance of Owner after Locker withdrawal:", await erc20Token.balanceOf(owner));
    
     }
   )}
 );
```
**Recommendation**

It is advised to transfer the ownership to the person who created the airdrop i.e. the one who transferred the funds into the locker and review the business and operational logic accordingly. It is also  advised to decentralize the following mechanism such as by using `multisig` or transfer the ownership to the appropriate owner who is responsible for depositing the tokens for creating the airdrop.

**Comment**: The client finds it risky to allow their users/depositor of airdrop to withdraw their airdrop when transferring funds to the new locker as this could lead to depositor withdrawing funds prior to the distribution of airdrop.


### Inadequate Handling of Fee-on-Transfer Tokens

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

The `AirdropFactory` contract does not account for tokens that charge a fee on transfer. When transferring such tokens, the actual amount received by the recipient is less than the specified amount due to the transfer fee. This discrepancy can cause issues in the airdrop distribution logic, leading to an incorrect distribution of tokens.

**Scenario**:

1) Airdrop Creation:
     - A user creates an airdrop project with ERC20 tokens that have a fee on transfer. The user specifies 1000 tokens to be transferred to the Locker contract.

2) Token Transfer:
     - Due to the fee-on-transfer mechanism, only 950 tokens (assuming a 5% fee) are actually received by the Locker contract.
     - The contract logic, however, assumes that 1000 tokens were transferred, leading to potential underfunding of the airdrop distribution.
    
3) Airdrop Distribution:
     - When distributing tokens, the discrepancy causes recipients to receive fewer tokens than intended, potentially leading to dissatisfaction and legal issues.

**Recommendation**:

1) Track Actual Received Amounts:
     - Modify the `_transferERC20Tokens` function to track the actual amount of tokens received by the recipient. This can be done by comparing the recipient’s balance before and after the transfer.
2) Handle Fee-on-Transfer Tokens:
     - Implement logic to handle tokens with transfer fees, ensuring that the actual received amounts are correctly accounted for in the airdrop distribution logic.
3) Emit Correct Amount in Events:
     - Ensure that events like `TokenTransferredToLocker` emit the actual received amounts rather than the intended transfer amounts.


### Missing length check between array parameters of `createAirdropProject()` and `createChapters()` functions

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: AirdropFactory.sol

**Description**

In the function `createAirdropProject()`, there is missing length check between length of `erc20RewardAddresses` of chapters array and the length `erc20Rewards` array parameter. This can result in the user transferring tokens to the locker via `createChapters`, but those tokens would be unclaimable by anyone via the `claimRewards()` function in `Airdrop.sol`. Resulting in loss of tokens or stuck funds for the depositor.

For example, if Bob provides 2 addresses of tokens for `erc20Rewards` such as usdt and pepe, but only one address of token i.e. usdt for `erc20RewardAddresses`. Then it will result in Bob transferring both the usdt and pepe to the Locker. But when the time comes for claiming the airdrop, only usdt would be claimable. This is because the chapter was created containing only 1 token as reward for airdrop i.e. usdt and not pepe.

The same issue also exists in `createChapters()`.
```solidity

   function createAirdropProject(
       uint256 parentAirdropId,
       ChapterData[] calldata chapters,
       ERC20Reward[] calldata erc20Rewards
   ) external payable nonReentrant {
```

**Recommendation**

It is advised to add an array length check for `chapters.erc20RewardAddresses` and `erc20Rewards` array length for both the `createAirdropProject()` and `createChapters()` functions. And ensure that both their length is the same.



###  Signatures can be replayed across chains and contracts

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

Location: Airdrop.sol

**Description**

It is possible that the signature is replayed on the different chains as the signature does not check for the chain id. Also it does not check for the address and can be replayed across 2 different contracts on the same chain but with the same code and different addresses.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to include the chain id as well as the address of the contract itself(i.e. address(this)) in the signature and do its verification during the claim process.

### Missing `disableinitializers()` in constructor can lead to malicious takeover of the implementation contract

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Airdrop.sol

**Description**

An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. But in case of the implementation contract, a `disableinitializers()` is necessary to be called in the constructor.
This is because when the Airdrop contract is deployed and initialized, the initialize method on the newly created AirdropZap proxy's implementation contract is never called. As such, anyone can call that method and pass in whatever values they want as arguments. If an attacker passes in a contract as argument that calls `selfdestruct`, it will be run in the context of the `AirdropZap` implementation contract and will erase all code from that address.

**Recommendation**

To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the `_disableInitializers()` function from Openzeppelin in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 ```solidity
 constructor() {
     _disableInitializers();
 }
```

### Centralization can lead to unfair changes without user’s notice 

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: Airdrop.sol and AirdropFactory.sol

**Description**

It is possible that the admin makes critical state changes to the code such as the `setFeeAmount()` function can be exploited to increase the fees to a very high amount without users notice. 
The functions such as `setLocker()` in `AirdropFactory.sol` can be used to change the locker address for any chapter without user’s notice or agreement too.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to:
1) Use a max value limit for fees.
2) Implement a timelock to ensure that there is a cooldown period for the changes to take into effect so that users can opt out if they want to.
3)  Use a multisig with at least ⅔ configure to ensure more decentralization and prevent risks of loss of private keys.

## Low Risk

### Calling pause pauses the claim process only but not deposit 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Airdrop.sol and AirdropFactory.sol

**Description**

Pausing of the contract Airdrop contract via `pause()` only pauses the claim process. It does not pause the creation of chapters and it is possible that users still interact with the contract to create new chapters and deposit funds in them. This can be detrimental if the contract has new bugs and ideally pause should be pausing the deposit of new tokens to until any issue or bug is resolved.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to also pause the deposit of any funds via `createAirdropProject()` and `createChapters()` when pause is called on the Airdrop contract until any issue is resolved.

### Use memory instead of storage in `createChapters()` function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: AirdropFactory.sol

**Description**

In `createChapters()`, storage has been used instead of memory for reading values from `AirdropList`. The usage of storage is not needed as there are no state changes that are being made in the function, and can save gas if memory is used instead.
```solidity
         AirdropConfig storage airdrop = AirdropList[parentAirdropId];
```
**Recommendation**

It is advised to use memory instead of storage here as no state changes are being made in the function.

### Incorrect/inconsistent comment with implementation for `Locker.sol`

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Locker.sol

**Description**

There is inconsistency in the comments and implementation in Locker.sol. The following code on line: 12 states that the contract implements IERC721Receiver for handling ERC721 tokens. But there is no such implementation in the contract.
```solidity
line: 12 /// @dev Implements both IERC721Receiver for handling incoming ERC721 tokens and ReentrancyGuard for secure native token transfers.
```
**Recommendation**

It is advised to either implement the said comment in the code or remove the comment to ensure consistency between the comments, specifications and their implementation.

### High Gas Costs for Large Arrays

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

In the `AirdropFactory` If the `erc20Rewards` array contains a large number of entries, the gas costs for this function can be prohibitively high, potentially causing the transaction to fail.
**Scenario**: A large number of ERC20 rewards are processed in a single transaction, exceeding the block gas limit and causing the transaction to revert.

**Recommendation**: 
Implement batch processing or offload the transfer process to a separate contract or service that can handle large numbers of transfers more efficiently.

## Informational

### Missing deadline for signatures 

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Location**: Airdrop.sol

**Description**

The signature is missing a deadline parameter. If there is no deadline provided for a signature, it can lead to the signature being valid for an indefinite amount of time. This is not advised as signatures should have a deadline and must be valid only for a specific duration.
The signatures without deadlines or expiration dates that aren't checked can be reused maliciously even after they should no longer be valid.
 
**Recommendation**

It is recommended that the expiration date of signatures be introduced and checked and ensure they're not accepted past their valid period.

### Lack of Verification for Chapter Creation

**Severity**: Informational 

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**: 

The createAirdropProject function does not verify whether chapters are successfully created.

**Scenario**: If the `createChapter` function in the `AirdropZap` contract fails, it could lead to inconsistencies without any indication to the user. This could result in a scenario where some chapters are not created, but the function proceeds as if they were, leading to confusion 

**Recommendation**: 

Add verification for the successful creation of chapters and handle failures appropriately. Emit events or revert the transaction if chapter creation fails.

### Potential for Out-of-Gas Errors in Loops

**Severity**: Informational 

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The `claimRewards` function from airdrop contract processes rewards in a loop, which can potentially lead to out-of-gas errors if the arrays are too large.

**Scenario**: If a large number of chapters or rewards are processed in a single transaction, it may exceed the gas limit and fail.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement gas optimizations and consider limiting the number of claims that can be processed in a single transaction.
