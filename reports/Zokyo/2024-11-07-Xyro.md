## Low Risk

### Centralization Risk Due to Whole Total Supply Minted to One Wallet

**Description**

On deployment, the entire total supply of the token is minted to a single wallet. This poses a
centralization risk as it gives one wallet complete control over the entire asset. This
concentration of power can lead to trust issues and potential misuse of tokens.
```solidity
constructor(
uint256 initialSupply
) BurnMintERC677("XYRO", "XYRO", 18, 0) EIP712("XYRO", "1") {
_mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
}
```
**Recommendation**:

To mitigate this centralization risk, consider transferring the tokens to a multisig wallet,
which requires multiple approvals for transactions, thereby distributing the control.
Additionally, implementing a vesting schedule for the tokens would ensure that not all tokens
are available for use immediately, which can help in maintaining stability and reducing risks
associated with large, single-point control.

**Client Comment**: 

We use multisig for deploy and will store all tokens there. As soon as
staking and vesting contracts are ready we will send tokens to these contracts. Until then it
is safest to store them on multisig.
