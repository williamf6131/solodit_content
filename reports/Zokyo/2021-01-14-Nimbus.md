# Findings

## High Risk

### Complicated dependency management, Solidity files contain all dependencies required for specific Contract.

**Recommendation**:

Split all solidity files to have one contract per Solidity file.

## Medium Risk

### Smart contracts are using outdated Solidity compiler versions (0.5.16, 0.6.6).

**Recommendation**:

Use up-to-date Solidity compiler version for all contracts.

### NUS.sol, NUS_WETH.sol, REWARDSFACTORY.sol are not referring to specific Solidity compiler version.

**Recommendation**:

Stick to the specific Solidity compiler version.

### StakingRewards.sol is a complete copy of the StakingRewards contract located at StakingRewardFactory.sol, and is not utilized by end product as StakingRewards has to be created by StakingRewardsFactory.

**Recommendation**:

Remove StakingRewards.sol

## Low Risk

### NBU.sol:39 add message to `require(msg.sender == owner, "Ownable: Caller is not the owner");`

### NBU.sol:369 multivest() should utilize existent method _vest to do multi vesting instead of repeating existent logic.

### NBU.sol:400 acceptOwnership() should utilize parent method from Ownable instead of repeating existent logic.

### NimbusReferralProgram:113 & 463 maxLevelDebth & updateMaxLevelDebth() have typo in method name.

### NimbusInitialAcquisition.sol:273 instead of making 2 requests just create one method that implement that logic.

## Informational

### File NimbisFactory.sol has an incorrect name.

**Recommendation**:

Rename file to NimbusFactory.sol

### NUS.sol, Code-style issue, method tokensBurner has incorrect name as it is not clearly states the goal of method.

**Recommendation**:

Rename method to reflect behaviour, like burnTokensByBurner or
burnOwnerTokensByBurner

### NUS_WETH.sol, Code-style issue, Owned & NUS_WETH contracts are having unexpected property names: NUSITERATOR, SWAPROUTER, NUSTOKEN, NUSWETH.

**Recommendation**:

Use camel case for all properties that are not constants.

### NUS_WETH.sol, Code-style issue, Nus_Weth contract name should be in Pascal case instead of Pascal Snake Case.

**Recommendation**:

Use pascal case for contract names.
