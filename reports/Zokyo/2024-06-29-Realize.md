## High Risk

### Incorrect logic in a while loop

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the `_removeBurnedBatches()` function, if `batch.amount` is less than `burnAmount`, it means that remaining is greater than `batch.amount` and the function goes to the “else” case.
In the else case, `ownerBatches[from][i]` is updated with a value of `ownerBatches[from][len - 1]`, but at the end of the iteration, i is increased by 1.
After that, the loop goes to the next iteration of the batch id with increased index.
In this case, the loop will skip the batch id moved from the last index to the index of i.
```solidity
while (remaining > 0 && i < len) {
    uint256 batchId = ownerBatches[from][i];
    Batch storage batch = batches[batchId];
    uint256 burnAmount = batch.amount > remaining ? remaining : batch.amount;


    if (burnAmount > 0) {
        if (batch.amount > burnAmount) {
            batch.amount -= burnAmount;
            remaining -= burnAmount;
        } else {
            remaining -= batch.amount;
            ownerBatches[from][i] = ownerBatches[from][len - 1];
            ownerBatches[from].pop();
            delete batches[batchId];
            len--;
        }
    }
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```

This issue exists in the `_transferBatches()` function as well.

This issue results in unexpected behaviors when burning and transferring.

**Recommendation**: 

Add “continue” at the end of the else case.

In the `_removeBurnedBatches()` function
```solidity
while (remaining > 0 && i < len) {
    uint256 batchId = ownerBatches[from][i];
    Batch storage batch = batches[batchId];
    uint256 burnAmount = batch.amount > remaining ? remaining : batch.amount;


    if (burnAmount > 0) {
        if (batch.amount > burnAmount) {
            batch.amount -= burnAmount;
            remaining -= burnAmount;
        } else {
            remaining -= batch.amount;
            ownerBatches[from][i] = ownerBatches[from][len - 1];
            ownerBatches[from].pop();
            delete batches[batchId];
            len--;
            continue;
        }
    }
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```
In the `_transferBatches()` function

```solidity
while (remaining > 0 && i < len) {
    uint256 batchId = fromOwnerBatches[i];
    Batch storage fromBatch = batches[batchId];
    uint256 transferAmount = fromBatch.amount > remaining ? remaining : fromBatch.amount;


    if (transferAmount > 0) {
        uint256 toBatchId = minterBatchMap[to][fromBatch.originalMinter];
        if (toBatchId != 0) {
            batches[toBatchId].amount += transferAmount;
        } else {
            toBatchId = batchCounter++;
            batches[toBatchId] = Batch(toBatchId, transferAmount, fromBatch.originalMinter);
            ownerBatches[to].push(toBatchId);
            minterBatchMap[to][fromBatch.originalMinter] = toBatchId;
        }


        if (fromBatch.amount > transferAmount) {
            fromBatch.amount -= transferAmount;
            remaining -= transferAmount;
        } else {
            remaining -= fromBatch.amount;
            fromOwnerBatches[i] = fromOwnerBatches[len - 1];
            fromOwnerBatches.pop();
            len--;
            continue;
        }
    }
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```

## Medium Risk

### Incorrect logic in the `onlyAdminOrOperator()` modifier

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

`onlyAdminOrOperator()` modifier in the `TokenPrice` contract is intended to be only passed when the caller has either `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` or `OPERATOR_ROLE`.
But the current logic of the modifier is only passed when the caller has both roles.

**Recommendation**: 

Replace || with &&.

### Incorrect Timestamp Validation in `addProof` Function

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:

The `addProof` function is designed to add proof of a transaction, but it contains a logical error in the timestamp validation and an unnecessary use of `block.timestamp`.
The current implementation checks if the provided timestamp is less than `block.timestamp` and reverts if it is not. However, this logic is flawed because proofs generally refer to past events. Therefore, the correct validation should ensure that the provided timestamp is in the past, meaning timestamp should be less than `block.timestamp`.

**Recommendation**: 

Correct the timestamp validation logic to ensure that the provided timestamp is in the past or remove the unnecessary check of `block.timestamp` in the condition.

## Low Risk

### Missing Price Boundaries in `addPriceAdmin` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `addPriceAdmin` function of `TokenPrice.sol` currently lacks necessary validations to ensure that the provided price falls within acceptable boundaries. Specifically, there are no checks to enforce maximum and minimum price constraints.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement maximum and minimum price validations within the `addPriceAdmin` function to ensure that all added prices fall within a predefined acceptable range.

### Missing Sanity Checks in `updateMaxPriceDeviation` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `updateMaxPriceDeviation` function allows an admin to update the `_maxPriceChangeBPS` value, which dictates the maximum allowable price change in basis points (bps). However, the current implementation lacks sanity checks to ensure that the provided `maxPriceChangeBPS` value is within a reasonable and safe range.

**Recommendation**:

Implement sanity checks within the `updateMaxPriceDeviation` function to ensure that the `maxPriceChangeBPS` value is within a predefined, reasonable range.

### Lack of Two-Step Ownership Transfer

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Token contract does not implement a two-step process for transferring ownership. In its current state, ownership can be transferred in a single step, which can be risky as it could lead to accidental or malicious transfers of ownership without proper verification.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a two-step process for ownership transfer where the new owner must explicitly accept the ownership. It is advisable to use OpenZeppelin’s Ownable2Step.

### Key Variables can not be updated after Initialization

**Severity**: Low
  
**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The initialize function sets up key components (`_collateral`, `_hubToken`, `_collateralRecipient`, `_pricer`) for the contract, ensuring they are only set once and not allowing for updates afterward. This immutable setup, while preventing accidental or malicious changes post-initialization, can be restrictive and problematic if updates to these components are necessary due to changes in business logic, upgrades, or corrections to initial inputs.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement setter functions for `_collateral`, `_hubToken`, `_collateralRecipient`, and `_pricer` to allow updating these variables post-initialization. Ensure that these setters are protected by appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized changes.

### Centralization Risk

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The smart contracts grant significant control to the contract owners through several functions. This centralization poses a substantial risk, as it places considerable trust and control in a single entity. If the owner's private key is compromised, it could lead to catastrophic disruptions or malicious misuse of the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a multi-signature wallet for executing Owner functions. This requires multiple authorized signatures to approve critical actions, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.


### Lack of access control on the `initialize()` function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `initialize()` functions of both `Hub` and `TokenManager` don’t have access control to prevent front running attacks.
And also the functions could be combined because the same variables are set in the functions.

**Recommendation**: 

Combine two functions into one and initialize the proxy contract during the contract creation.

### Missing events

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The following functions are missing events when key storages are updated.
	- setTrackOnChainPaused() function in the Token contract.
	- updateMaxPriceDeviation() and addPrice() function in the TokenPrice contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Add relative events based on the variables to be updated.

## Informational

### Unnecessary check
	
**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved
	
In the `initialize()` function of the TokenManager contract, it checks if the `listPerOperation[operationTypeIndex[i]]` is zero.
But the `initialize()` function in the TokenManager contract is only called once and the `listPerOperation` mapping variable is only updated in the `initialize()` function.
It means that `listPerOperation[operationTypeIndex[i]]` can not be zero while initializing.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the condition to check if the `listPerOperation[operationTypeIndex[i]]` is zero.

### Granting roles in the constructor
	
**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TokenManager contract is intended to be an upgradeable contract and the deployer is granted `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and `HUB_ADMIN_ROLE` in the constructor.
However, these changes are executed only in the Implementation contract. Not on a proxy contract. It means the deployer only gets the roles after executing the `initialize()` function on the proxy contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the role grant part in the constructor.
