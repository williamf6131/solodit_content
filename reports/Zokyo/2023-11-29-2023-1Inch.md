## Medium Risk


### UNFILTERED TOKENS  LEADS CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING

**Severity**: Medium 

**Status**: Resolved

**Location** : @getsafle/asset-controller


**Description**  : 

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. During the test, it is seen that there is no input/output filtering on the vault SDK.

getEthAssets,  getPolygonAssets and getBSCAssets  these functions detect tokens for a specific user address on a given blockchain network. If an attacker deploys a malicious smart contract with an XSS payload and adds it to the user's wallet, the detectTokens function may parse and include this malicious token as well. This can potentially compromise the user's wallet and lead to loss of funds or data.
A proof-of-concept (PoC) for this attack could involve the following steps:
The attacker deploys a malicious ERC20 token smart contract with an XSS payload on the Ethereum, Polygon, or BSC blockchain network.


The attacker adds this malicious token to the victim's wallet address.
The getEthAssets, getPolygonAssets, or getBSCAssets function is called for the victim's wallet address.
The function detects the malicious token and includes it in the list of tokens.
The malicious payload in the token is executed when the victim accesses or interacts with it, potentially compromising the victim's wallet.

**Impact**:

An attacker could use this vulnerability to inject a malicious payload into a token's name and execute arbitrary code on the user's device when they view their wallet. This could lead to sensitive data theft, financial losses, or other malicious activities.

**Remediation**:

The vulnerability can be fixed by sanitizing the token data before displaying them to the user. The library should use a DOM sanitizer, such as DOMPurify, to sanitize the token names before rendering them
