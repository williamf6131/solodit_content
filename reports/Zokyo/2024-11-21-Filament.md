## High Risk

### User Controlled Options Price

**Severity** - Critical

**Severity** - Resolved

**Description**

When joining a duel the amount put up as wager is compared against an options price and can’t be lower than that price. But since the options price is controlled by the user →
```solidity
function joinDuel(
        string memory _duelId,
        string memory _option,
        uint256 _optionsIndex,
        uint256 _optionPrice,
        uint256 _amount
    )
```

The user can provide a very low value as the option price( 1 wei)  , in that case the amountTokenToMint would be large →
```solidity
uint256 amountTokenToMint = (_amount * 1e18) / _optionPrice;
```
, even for 1 usdc amountTokenToMint would be 1e6*1e18 / 1 = 1e24 options token minted to the user. This way user can make their option token balance abruptly large in order to receive larger rewards.

**Recommendation**:

Have a min cap on the option price or let the admin decide this value in a setter function.



### Users Can Lose All Their Rewards Even If Their Option Won The Duel

**Severity** - Critical

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

Consider the following →

UserA joins a duel (say duelId = 1)  , provides an option and an option index , and as amount provides 1000 USDC
This would deploy a new options token , like this →
OptionToken newOptionToken = new OptionToken(_option, _option);

And mapping will be updated for the optionIndex →
optionIndexToOptionToken[_duelId][_optionsIndex] = address(newOptionToken);

And this newOptionToken is minted to the user →

newOptionToken.mint(msg.sender, amountTokenToMint);

Now userB arrives and joins the same duel i.e. duelId = 1 , provides the same option string and same optionIndex as userA , therefore for userB also a new option token will be deployed which will have a different address than above , and the mapping would be overridden and the amount will be minted to UserB →
           optionIndexToOptionToken[_duelId][_optionsIndex] = address(newOptionToken);


Therefore , now when rewards are being distributed and the optionIndex was chosen as the winner , this logic is executed to calculate option shares →
```solidity
            function _getUserDuelOptionShare(
        string memory _duelId,
        uint256 _optionIndex,
        address _user
    ) internal view returns (uint256 optionShare) {
        address optionToken = optionIndexToOptionToken[_duelId][_optionIndex];
        uint256 optionTokenBalance = IERC20(optionToken).balanceOf(_user);
        uint256 totalOptionTokenSupply = IERC20(optionToken).totalSupply();
        optionShare = (optionTokenBalance * 1e18) / totalOptionTokenSupply;
    }

```
          As you can see optiontoken would correspond to the token deployed by userB and not userA since it was overridden , and for userA optionTokenBalance would be 0 even though he put up 1000 USDC to wager and optionShare would come out to be 0.

**Recommendation**:

If the option token is already deployed for an option then don’t re-deploy the option token and update the optionIndexToOptionToken mapping.


### Rounding While Calculating Option Shares Might Lead To Winner Receiving 0 Rewards

**Severity** - High

**Status** - Acknowledged

The winning option shares is calculated as follows →
```solidity
function _getUserDuelOptionShare(
        string memory _duelId,
        uint256 _optionIndex,
        address _user
    ) internal view returns (uint256 optionShare) {
        address optionToken = optionIndexToOptionToken[_duelId][_optionIndex];
        uint256 optionTokenBalance = IERC20(optionToken).balanceOf(_user);
        uint256 totalOptionTokenSupply = IERC20(optionToken).totalSupply();
        optionShare = (optionTokenBalance * 1e18) / totalOptionTokenSupply;
    }
```

If the user has 1e18 option token and the totalOptionTokenSupply is > 1e36 , then user’s optionShare would come out to be 0 and even though he won the duel (one of the winners) he received 0 rewards and also lose their initial wager deposit due to →
```solidity
uint256 totalWinningWagers = totalWagerForOption[_duelId][_winningOption];
        uint256 winningOptionPoolBalance = totalWinningWagers + _payout;


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < winners.length; i++) {
            address winner = winners[i];
            uint256 winnerShare = _getUserDuelOptionShare(_duelId, _optionIndex, winner);
            uint256 winnerWinningTokenAmount = (winnerShare * winningOptionPoolBalance) / 1e18;
```
This being 0 since the winning share would be 0.

**Recommendation**: 

The precision should be increased while calculating the option shares.


**Client comment**: The precisiion has been kept upto 18 decimals which is the ideal case for any ERC20 token standards.

option share will be become 0, when token option supply will reach 10,000,000,000, which is not possible in an ideal scenario.


### Potential Funds Lockup 

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The settleDuel function enforces a condition that the duel must be settled within 48 hours of its expiryTime using the line require(block.timestamp <= duel.expiryTime + (48 * 3600), "Resolving time expired");. If this 48-hour window is missed and the bot didn’t call settleDuel, the duel remains in the Live status indefinitely, preventing any future attempts to settle it. Consequently, all USDC or assets wagered within this duel are permanently locked within the contract, as there is no alternative mechanism to withdraw funds after this period has elapsed.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider implementing a fallback mechanism to handle duels that exceed the 48-hour settlement window. 

## Medium Risk

### Add require Statement For USDC Transfers

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

When joining a duel the USDC token transfer has been wrapped inside a require statement , this is to ensure that the transfer didn’t fail . But this require check is missing in →

L619 FlashDuels.sol
L630 FlashDuels.sol
L642 FlashDuels.sol
L606 FlashDuels.sol



**Recommendation**:  

Add a require statement as advised.


### Potential DoS Due to Large Winners Array in _distributeWinnings

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The _distributeWinnings function iterates through the winners array, distributing rewards to each participant. If this array becomes very large, the gas cost of the transaction could exceed block gas limits, making the function uncallable. This would result in rewards getting stuck and prevent winners from claiming their payouts.

**Recommendation**: 

Break down the rewards distribution into smaller chunks that can be executed across multiple transactions to stay within gas limits. 

	
### Missing gap to Avoid Storage Collisions

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contracts are intended to be an upgradeable smart contracts, but do not have a __gap variable.
In upgradeable contracts, it's crucial to include a _gap to ensure that any additional storage variables added in future contract upgrades do not collide with existing storage variables. This is especially important when inheriting from multiple upgradeable contracts.

**Recommendation**: 

Include a _gap as the last storage variable to FlashDuelsMarketplace and FlashDuels contracts to reserve space for future storage variables and prevent storage collisions. This is a common practice to ensure compatibility and avoid issues when upgrading the contract in the future.

	
### Invalidated Token Symbol Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

The FlashDuels contract allows users to create duels and specify token symbols, particularly in functions like createCryptoDuel. If the contract does not validate or sanitize the tokenSymbol input provided by users, it opens up the possibility for malicious actors to inject harmful scripts or unexpected data. When these unvalidated token symbols are stored on-chain and later retrieved by off-chain applications (e.g., web frontends) that display duel information, they may inadvertently execute malicious code embedded within the token symbol.
This vulnerability is particularly concerning in decentralized applications (dApps) where user-generated content is directly displayed to other users without proper sanitization. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks can compromise user data, manipulate page content, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of users.

**Recommendation** : 


Add validation directly in contract  or in frontend use dompurify Lib


**Client comment**: 

Fronted: Yes, from frontend we have secured this by ensuring tokenSymbol should be sent in proper format.
And, we won't be displaying any tokenSymbol in frontend, that's used for mapping for tokenPrice in the contract.

## Low Risk

### Lack of Seller Balance Verification in sell Function

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

The sell function checks the seller's token allowance but not their actual token balance. Sellers without sufficient tokens can create sales that cannot be fulfilled, leading to failed transactions for buyers.

**Scenario**:

A seller creates a sale without holding the tokens they are offering. Buyers attempt to purchase from this sale, but the transfer fails because the seller lacks the necessary balance, causing buyers to waste gas on failed transactions.

**Recommendation**:

Add a balance check in the sell function:
```solidity
require(erc20.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= quantity, "Insufficient token balance");
```

### Lack of Ether Withdrawal Functionality

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The FlashDuels contract includes both fallback() and receive() functions to accept incoming Ether. However, there is no function that allows the contract to withdraw or transfer the Ether back out. Any Ether sent to the contract, intentionally or accidentally, would remain locked indefinitely, leading to the potential loss of funds.

**Recommendation**:

Add a function to enable the contract owner to withdraw Ether from the contract. Include an access control modifier, such as onlyOwner, to restrict this functionality to the contract owner.

	
### Lack of Validation in Setter Functions

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The setter functions setCreateDuelFee and setMinimumWagerThreshold in FlashDuels and updateFee in FlashDuelsMarketplace allow the contract owner to set new values for createDuelFee and minThreshold and Fees without upper or lower bounds. Without validation, these values could be set to extreme values, which could negatively impact the contract’s usability or lead to unintended behavior.

**For example**:

Setting createDuelFee and Fees to an extremely high amount could discourage users from creating duels.
Setting minThreshold too low or too high could also disrupt the intended game mechanics.

**Recommendation**: 

Introduce validation checks within these setter functions to restrict createDuelFee, minThreshold and Fees to reasonable ranges.



### Missing Event Emissions in Setter Functions

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Several setter functions in the contract update critical state variables without emitting corresponding events. Event emissions in setter functions provide an essential audit trail on the blockchain, allowing users, auditors, and developers to track when and how key parameters are modified. Without these events, it becomes challenging to trace changes, which may impact transparency and debugging.

**Recommendation**: 

Add event emissions for each setter function, especially those that modify critical state variables or impact contract behavior. E.g.
```solidity
// Define events
event CreateDuelFeeUpdated(uint256 newFee);
event MinimumWagerThresholdUpdated(uint256 newThreshold);
event BotAddressUpdated(address newBotAddress);

// Update setter functions
function setCreateDuelFee(uint256 _fee) external onlyOwner {
    createDuelFee = _fee;
    emit CreateDuelFeeUpdated(_fee);
}

function setMinimumWagerThreshold(uint256 _minThreshold) external onlyOwner {
    minThreshold = _minThreshold;
    emit MinimumWagerThresholdUpdated(_minThreshold);
}

function setBotAddress(address _bot) external onlyOwner {
    require(_bot != address(0), "Invalid bot address");
    bot = _bot;
    emit BotAddressUpdated(_bot);
}
```


### Lack of Two-Step Ownership Transfer 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contracts does not implement a two-step process for transferring ownership. In its current state, ownership can be transferred in a single step, which can be risky as it could lead to accidental or malicious transfers of ownership without proper verification.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a two-step process for ownership transfer where the new owner must explicitly accept the ownership. It is advisable to use OpenZeppelin’s Ownable2StepUpgradeable.



### The owner can renounce ownership

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Ownable contracts includes a function named renounceOwnership() which can be used to remove the ownership of the contract. 
If this function is called on the FlashDuelsMarketplace and FlashDuels contracts, it will result in the contract becoming disowned. This would subsequently break functions of the token that rely on onlyOwner modifier.



 **Recommendation**: 
 
 override the function to disable its functionality, ensuring the contract cannot be disowned e.g.


### ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable Not Initialized

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


The FlashDuelsMarketplace and FlashDuels contracts uses ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, which is a safeguard against reentrancy attacks. However, the initialize function does not call __ReentrancyGuard_init() to properly initialize the ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable component.

**Recommendation**: 

In the initialize function, ensure __ReentrancyGuard_init() is called to correctly initialize reentrancy protection.


### Make Sure The Options Array Has Length 2 While Creating A Crypto Duel

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Description**

A crypto duel has 2 trigger condition i.e. either Above or Below and the winning option can be either option[0] or option[1] . But while creating a crypto duel ( createCryptoDuel) there’s no check  on the length of the _options array and can be larger than 2 anf in that case the results of the duel can be incorrect if configured incorrectly.

**Recommendation**:

Add a check that options array has length == 2

**Client comment**: 

We would have multiple options(more than 2)  in the future. For now, options may be YES or NO, but we could have multiple options in the future.
It's not about trigger condition.

## Informational

### Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern Not Followed

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contract does not strictly follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern in functions involving external calls, especially during token transfers. Typically, this pattern helps reduce risks of reentrancy attacks by ensuring that state updates occur before external calls. While this issue is marked as informational due to the use of standard ERC20 tokens (which generally do not permit reentrancy callbacks), it’s worth noting for best practices.

**Recommendation**:

For optimal security and readability, refactor functions involving external token transfers to ensure internal state updates are completed before any external calls.


### Require Statement Can Be Removed

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved

The function cancelDuelIfThresholdNotMet has the following checks →
```solidity
require(
                duel.duelStatus != DuelStatus.Cancelled && duel.duelStatus != DuelStatus.Settled,
                "Duel already cancelled or settled"
            );
            // Check if the duel hasn't started (still in bootstrap period)
            require(duel.duelStatus == DuelStatus.BootStrapped, "Duel already started");
```
Out of these only the second require statement is sufficient which ensures the status to be bootstrapped. The same can be said for the require statement at L551.
