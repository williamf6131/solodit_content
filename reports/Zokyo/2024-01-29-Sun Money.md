# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Centralization Risk

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Unresolved

**Location**: _remove, withdrawTokens, withdrawBNB

**Description**

The smart contract employs the onlyOwner modifier in functions responsible for ERC20 and native coin asset transfers. This approach centralizes control, allowing a single owner to exclusively perform critical actions, such as token transfers, posing a risk to decentralization principles.
Risks: Single Point of Failure: Centralized control introduces a single point of failure, where the compromise of the owner's account can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of critical functions.
Lack of Trustless Operation: The centralization of asset transfer functions undermines the trustless nature of decentralized applications, as users are reliant on the owner's actions.

**Recommendation**

To mitigate the centralization risk associated with the onlyOwner modifier, it is recommended to:
Implement Access Control Lists (ACL): Utilize Access Control Lists to assign different roles with specific permissions, allowing for a more granular and decentralized control structure.
Multi-Sig or Governance Contracts: Consider implementing multi-signature schemes or governance contracts to distribute decision-making authority, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

### Insufficent ERC20 transfer validation

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Unresolved

**location**: multiTransfer

**Description**

Function `[multiTransfer]` requires the msg.sender to possess the total amount of the asset being transferred as shown in the following:
```solidity
require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= totalAmount, "Insufficient balance");
```
This validation though does not verify that msg.sender actually approved SBDN3 with enough allowance to undergo these several transfer operations (i.e. `allowance >= totalAmount`). The potential impact is that we end up having failed transfers alongside successful transfers due to the lack of ERC20 transfer validations.

**Recommendation** 

Utilize SafeERC20 (i.e. recommended in next finding) or validate the allowance alongside the totalBalance.

## Low Risk

### Lack of SafeERC20 Implementation in Token Transfers:

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Unresolved

**Location**: withdrawTokens, multiTransfer

**Description**

The smart contract does not utilize the SafeERC20 library when performing token transfers for arbitrary tokens. The absence of SafeERC20 may expose the contract to potential vulnerabilities during token interactions, including mishandling of exceptions.
Risk: Exception Mishandling: The absence of SafeERC20 may result in inadequate handling of exceptions during token transfers, introducing the risk of unexpected contract behavior.

**Recommendation**: 

To enhance the security of token transfers, it is strongly recommended to: Incorporate SafeERC20 Library by implementing the SafeERC20 library to utilize its secure functions, such as safeTransfer, safeTransferFrom, and safeApprove, when interacting with arbitrary tokens.

## Informational

### Input address `tokenAddress` lacks proper validation

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Location**: multiTransfer, withdrawTokens

**Description**

In functions [`multiTransfer`, `withdrawTokens`] the argument `tokenAddress` can refer to any arbitrary token. In that sense that arbitrary token can be referring to the SDBN3 token itself. The functions should ensure that `tokenAddress != address(this)`. If it is a required feature to have the contract implement this sort of transfers to SDBN3 (i.e. itself) then it is recommended to have such implementations written in separate functions that utilizes the internal calls [i.e. `balanceOf()`, `transferFrom()`, `transfer()`] rather than the external calls utilized here.

**Recommendation** 

Require that `tokenAddress` is not equal to the address of the deployed SDBN3 contract.

### Input validation lacking in `_remove`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Location**: _remove

**Description**

Input addresses from and to are not asserted to be different addresses.
```solidity
   function _remove(address _from, address _to) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 blanace = balanceOf(_from);
        _burn(_from, blanace);
        _mint(_to, blanace);
    }
```
The expected side effect after executing this function is to have zero balance for the from address. But in the case both of to and from refer to same account, that side effect will not take place hence leading to an unexpected behaviour.

**Recommendation** 

Add a require statement to revert the transaction in case the addresses are the same.

### Unnecessary Safe Math is being utilized

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Location**: multiTransfer

**Description**

The default safe math operation in solidity versions ^0.8.x incurs extra gas overhead due to it requiring more computation. The following operation, that is being carried out on the iterator of the for-loop, can be more gas-efficient by using the unchecked statement.

```solidity
       for (uint256 i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
            token.transferFrom(msg.sender, recipients[i], amounts[i]);
        }
```
While the code snippet correctly ensures that the addition operation will not result in an overflow, the unnecessary default safe math usage can be optimized for gas efficiency. Wrapping the operation in an unchecked statement is a recommended practice for situations where the developer can guarantee that overflows/underflows will not occur. This enhancement contributes to more efficient gas utilization without compromising safety.

**Recommendation** 

Wrap Operation in unchecked Statement, given that the condition preceding the operation ensures there is no risk of overflow.
```solidity
       for (uint256 i = 0; i < recipients.length;) {
            token.transferFrom(msg.sender, recipients[i], amounts[i]);
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
```

### Floating Pragma Version in Solidity File

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

The Solidity file contains a pragma statement specifying the compiler version in a floating manner (e.g., ^0.8.0). Floating pragmas can introduce unpredictability in contract behavior, as they allow automatic adoption of newer compiler versions that may introduce breaking changes.
Recommendation: To ensure stability and predictability in contract behavior, it is recommended to:
Specify Fixed Compiler Version: Instead of using a floating pragma, specify a fixed compiler version to ensure consistency across different deployments and prevent automatic adoption of potentially incompatible compiler versions.

### Suboptimal Code Structure with Two Separate For Loops

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Unresolved

**Location**: multiTransfer

**Description**

The function [`multiTransfer`] contains two separate for loops that iterate over similar data structures. Consolidating these loops into a single loop can enhance code efficiency and reduce gas consumption.
It is worth noting that the usage of SafeERC20 shall make it feasible to get rid of this code section:
```solidity
       for (uint256 i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
            totalAmount += amounts[i];
        }

        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= totalAmount, "Insufficient balance");
```
This is because a failure in one transfer due to insufficient balance from sender or insufficient allowance (i.e not even included here) will revert the transaction altogether.

**Recommendation** 

To improve code efficiency and reduce gas consumption, it is recommended to utilize only the second for-loop after following other related recommendations.
