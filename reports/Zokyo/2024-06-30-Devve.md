# Findings

## High Risk

### Possible Read-only Reentrance in Refund

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

It was identified that the `treasury.sol` smart contract doesn’t fully implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern in most functions. For instance, An attacker could exploit the contract via Read-only Reentrancy between `refundFromAdminInETH()` and `refund()` functions.
Furthermore, the use of the native `transfer()` function for sending Ether, which has a limited gas stipend of 2300 but since it’s deprecated and it’s recommended to use `.call` instead, Then reentrancy is possible.   

Consider the following scenario:

1. Admin calls `refundFromAdminInETH()` and `investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH` are updated only after the external call.

2. Before the state gets updated, the attacker receives the fallback and calls `refund()`.
    > Even though `refund()` has a nonReentrant modifier the contract is not locked yet because it wasn’t called in  `refundFromAdminInETH`.

3. Since `investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH` is not updated yet, The attacker is able to refund again.

```solidity
File: treasury.sol
1241:     function refundFromAdminInETH(uint projectId, uint slotId) external  { 
..
1248:             
1249:             payable(user).transfer(investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH[projectId][user]); 
1250:          projectTotalCollectedInETH[projectId]-=investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH[projectId][user];
1251:          investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH[projectId][user]-=investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH[projectId][user];
1252:         }
1253: 
1254:     }


File: treasury.sol
1199:     function refund(Whitelist memory users) external payable nonReentrant { 
..
1212:         } else {
1213:             require (!refundAmountInETH[users.userAddress][users.projectId],"!Refund completed");
1214:             require (investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH[users.projectId][users.userAddress] >= amount,'Invalid Amount to retrieve');
1215:             investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH[users.projectId][users.userAddress] -= amount;
1216:             payable (users.userAddress).transfer(amount);
1217:             projectTotalCollectedInETH[users.projectId]-=amount;
1218:             refundAmountInETH[users.userAddress][users.projectId]=true;
1219:         }
1220:     }
```
Please note that other functions also needs to implement CEI pattern like:

`settleProjectOwnerFund`
`withdrawAllFundsOfAProject`
`refundFromAdminInUSDT`



**Recommendation**: 

Refactor the contract to strictly follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Ensure that all state changes are made before any external calls.


### Admin refunding functionality can become unavailable if the users array for a project grows large enough

**Severity**: High	

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `refundFromAdminInETH()` and `refundFromAdminInUSDT()` functions are only callable by the owner and serve to refund every user in `projectUsersInETH[projectId][slotId]` and `projectUsersInUSDT[projectId][slotId].length` arrays. The refunding mechanism goes through a for loop for each user so if the number of users grows enough so that transactions run out of gas then refunding will not be available. This can be exploited by a malicious user who decides to use multiple addresses to invest 1 wei into the project. When the admin decides to trigger a refund, the call will revert to an out of gas error. This was rated a high severity because it causes funds to be inaccessible while being cheap to attack. 

**Recommendation**:

It’s recommended that admin refunds are processed in batches as state variables are theoretically boundless. 


### User-Settable Decimals 

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Treasury contract allows users to set the decimals value in all the functionalities, which can lead to inconsistent behavior and potential errors. Instead, the contract should retrieve the decimals directly from the token, e.g. from the USDT contract using `usdt.decimals()`.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the uint decimal parameter and retrieve the decimals directly from the USDT contract or any other token you’re willing to support.


### Client Side Signatures Used To Stake In the Staking Contract Can Be Reused To Bypass UI Restrictions (Signature Replayability)

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

When a user stakes into the contract, there is a requirement that the signer has first signed the message before executing their stake (the signer being the application client side). The staking signature can then be reused by bots or other smart contracts in order to modify their positions by reusing the signature used in `stakeTokens`. This was rated a High in severity because this bypasses one of the invariants intended by the protocol that is to streamline the user experience through the client side, leveraging this bug, a user is able to bypass client side checks in order to upgrade their stake tokens for free by supplying the same signature to `upgradeStakeTokens`. 

**Recommendations**: 

It’s recommended that the signer’s (or Client Side) signature nonce used for each function call is immediately expired after it’s used. This will ensure that the contract is only interacted with via the UI. 

### Treasury is Incompatible with USDT

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Treasury.sol contract uses `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to interact with USDT. However, USDT does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard and may not revert on failure and it also doesn’t return a boolean. This makes the contract incompatible with USDT in Ethereum and may lead to unexpected behaviors.

Upon reviewing the implementation code of the USDT token on Polygon, it appears that the issue present on Ethereum is not present there. However, it is still advisable to implement proper handling to ensure maximum safety.

**Recommendation**: 

Use SafeERC20 library from OpenZeppelin, which handles these inconsistencies and ensures compatibility with tokens like USDT.


### Incorrect Handling of Investment Amounts

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved 

**Description**

The `investInProjects()` function in Treasury.sol does not validate that `msg.value` matches `users.amount`. Instead, it adds `msg.value` to `investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH`. 

The following attack vectors may happen:

1. Users can send a different `msg.value` than specified in `users.amount`, leading to incorrect recording of investments. 

2. In the `settleProjectOwnerFunds` function, the transferred amount is based on `users.amount`, not `investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH`. This can result in either overpayment or underpayment to the project owner, depending on the actual `msg.value` sent during the investment.

```solidity
File: treasury.sol
1178:     function settleProjectOwnerFunds(Whitelist memory users) external  {
..
1191:             else {
1192:                 fundsWithdrawn[users.projectId][users.inETH] += _amountToWithdraw;
1193:                 uint deducedAmount = projectTotalCollectedInETH[users.projectId] - (projectTotalCollectedInETH[users.projectId] *(users.platformFee))/100;
1194:                 require (deducedAmount >= fundsWithdrawn[users.projectId][users.inETH],"check deducedAmount");
1195:                 payable(users.userAddress).transfer(_amountToWithdraw); //@audit this should be investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH
1196:                 projectTotalCollectedInETH[users.projectId]-=_amountToWithdraw;
1197:             }
```


**Recommendation**: 

Validate that `msg.value` equals `users.amount` in the `investInProjects` function to ensure the recorded investment amount matches the actual amount sent and in `settleProjectOwnerFunds` the transferred amount should be based on `investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH`.



### Missing Decimals Conversion in `settleProjectOwnerFunds`

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `settleProjectOwnerFunds()` function in Treasury.sol does not account for the decimal conversion of the `users.amount` when calculating `_amountToWithdraw`. This can lead to incorrect fund settlements

```solidity
File: treasury.sol
1178:     function settleProjectOwnerFunds(Whitelist memory users) external  {
..
1183:             uint _amountToWithdraw = users.amount ; 
```

**Recommendation**: 

Ensure that the amount is properly converted to account for the decimals of the token. For USDT, this typically means multiplying by 10**6 to adjust the decimal places correctly.

### Calculation of `tokensToWithdraw` is wrong.

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the `withdrawAirdropTokens()` and `getCurrentAirdropBalance()` functions, `tokensToWithdraw` is assumed to be calculated by multiplying `airdropTokenPerDay` by the number of days passed since the last withdrawal. But it's calculated by multiplying `airdropTokenPerDay` by the number of minutes passed.
It can result in larger airdrops than expected.

**Recommendation**: 

Calculate the correct number of elapsed days and multiply it by `airdropTokensPerDay` to calculate the `tokensToWithdraw`.


### User’s stakes after admin’s removed can not be refunded again

**Severity**: High	

**Status**: Resolved

If users continue staking after admin has executed `refundFromAdminInETH()` or `refundFromAdminInUSDT()` in `treasury.sol` then the funds will not be able to get refunded again. These functions implements a check `require (!isRefundedInUSDT[user][projectId],'Already refunded');` which does not allow refunding more than one. The following scenario can take place:

- Alice stakes 200k USDT.
- Admin refunds users.
- Alice stakes 200k USDT more.
- Admin can not refund again.

**Recommendation:**

Allow refunding more than once but keep track of user funds to not refund more tokens than staked by the user.

## Medium Risk

### Partial Refunds Are Not Possible In The Treasury Due To Assumption That A User Has Fully Withdrawn 

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

A user is able to invest into a certain project via the treasury contract function `investInProjects()`. Due to an assumption made when a user withdraws from a project `refundAmountInUSDT[users.userAddress][users.projectId]` is set to true even for partial withdrawals which will deny them collecting the rest of their funds. This was rated a Medium in severity because this causes significant disruption to funds for the project and other users as the only other way to retrieve funds is for the admin to call `refundFromAdminInUSDT` which will process the withdrawals for ALL users leaving the project with zero dollars in funding because one person made a mistake.

**Recommendation**: 

The `refund()` function in the treasury contract requires refactoring to allow users to partially withdraw their investment should they choose to. Only set `refundAmountInUSDT[users.userAddress][users.projectId]` to true once the entire balance is withdrawn.

**Client comment**: We implement no further actions as defined in the client feedback sheet.


### Overshadowing Of token in `Staking.withDrawFunds` May Cause Accidental Change to Staking Token

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `withDrawFunds` function in the Staking contract is used for administrators to clean out unusable tokens or to rescue funds in case there is an exploitable bug in the Solidity code. `_tokenAddress`  is passed, however, the token state variable is initialized to this token address. Accidental passing of an incorrect token address may cause the reset of the token state variable which may cause users to lose their tokens.

**Recommendation**: 

Create a temporary variable `_token` when cleaning out or rescuing tokens from the contract via `withDrawFunds`.


### Insufficient Validation On `lockType` When Staking May Cause Negligent Users To Temporarily Lose Their Stakes Until Admin Recovery

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

When users stake into the staking contract they are able to supply an arbitrary `lockType` which may or may not exist, users who supply a lock type which does not exist may not have access to the `unStake` function due to the check of `locktype` existence. As a result, admins may have to rescue their tokens in order for them to gain their funds back hence, the medium in severity reasoning.

**Recommendation**: 

It’s recommended that the `setTimeLocks` has it’s length enforced to ensure that only a certain amount of time locks exist. When users attempt to stake in the contract, ensure that the lock time first exists, if the lock type is non existent, revert. 
 
### Users May Lose Their Stake If `setToken` Is Called For A Second Time With An Alternative Address

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The `setToken` function is used to initially set the token used for staking within the Staking contract however, there is a lack of checks which allow owners to accidentally reset the staking token to cause a temporary loss of funds before resetting it back. 

Consider the following scenario:

- `Token` is set to address(A)
- User stakes X amount of tokens address(A)
- Owner changes `token` to address(B)
- User now can not unstake the previously staked tokens address(A) and will remain locked.

**Recommendation**: 

It’s recommended that there is a check that the token is already set by including a check `require(token == address(0) || totalStaking == 0)` before resetting the staking token to ensure that no more users are staked into the protocol.

**Client comment**: The only change was checking if input address is `address(0)`

### Centralized actor can drain the whole protocol.

**Severity**: Medium	

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The function `withDrawFunds()` in the `staking.sol` contract allows the owner to withdraw any token at any time. This means that the owner can withdraw tokens staked by other users even if the timelock is still active. There have been some previous attacks like this as the Merlin Dex Rug Pull was a significant incident that occurred on April 25, 2023, where the decentralized exchange (DEX) Merlin suffered a loss of approximately $1.8 million. The incident was initially believed to be a hack, but it was later confirmed to be an internal rug pull because of an overstepping in owner privileges. This attack took advantage of the centralization issue of the pair contract by one of the developers. Check it out: https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/644cbd51fec63d16dc58e90a/.

**Recommendation:**

If the purpose of this function is to behave like an ‘emergency withdraw’ a good option could be creating a function which the owner could call to set an ‘emergency variable’ to true in case of emergency and a function that allows users to withdraw their funds directly when this variable is set to true.

### User can bypass the max amount restriction 

**Severity**: Medium	

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The function `upgradeStakeTokens()` implements a `require` statement to ensure that the total staked amount by the user is less or equal to 1000 tokens when the lockType is 1.
```solidity
if(_locktype == 1){
               require(totalamount<=1000*10**18 ,"max amount reached"); 
}
```

This restriction is missing in the `stakeTokens` function, meaning that users can stake more than 1000 tokens for lockType 1 directly by the `stakeTokens` function.

**Recommendation**:

Add the same `require` statement to the `stakeTokens()` function.

### `stakeLength()` function does not return the actual length of stakers

**Severity**: Medium	

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**
  
The `stakeLength()` function in `staking.sol` is a function that returns the length of `userStakeInformation`. A new element is added `userStakeInformation` each time a user stakes tokens. When a user unstakes tokens the information in `userStakeInformation` is deleted but the size is not reduced.

This means that if:
- User A stakes.
- User B stakes.
- User A unstakes.
The length of `userStakeInformation` will be 3 instead of 2.

**Proof of concept:**

```solidity
function testPOCDeleteMapping() public {
       vm.startPrank(address(alice));
       stakingToken.mint(address(alice), 1 ether);
       uint _amount = 1 ether;
       uint _locktype = 0;
       whitelistChecker.Signer memory _signer;
       _signer.userAddress = address(alice);
       _signer.contractAddress = address(staking);
       _signer.id = 0;
       _signer.timestamp = block.timestamp;
       _signer.signature = '0x';

       // Stake tokens
       stakingToken.approve(address(staking), _amount);
       staking.stakeTokens(_amount, _locktype, _signer);

       // Unstake
       vm.warp(block.timestamp + 8 days);
       uint256 stakeLengthBeforeUnstake = staking.stakeLength(address(alice));
       (uint256 stakedAmountBefore,,,) = staking.userStakeInformation(address(alice), 0);
       staking.unStake(0, _signer);
       uint256 stakeLengthAfterUnstake = staking.stakeLength(address(alice));
       assert(stakeLengthAfterUnstake == stakeLengthBeforeUnstake);

       (uint256 stakedAmountAfter,,,) = staking.userStakeInformation(address(alice), 0);
       console.log("StakedLengthLogs", stakeLengthBeforeUnstake, stakeLengthAfterUnstake);
       console.log("StakedAmountLogs", stakedAmountBefore, stakedAmountAfter);
   }
```

**Logs:**
```
StakedLengthLogs 1 1
StakedAmountLogs 1000000000000000000 0
```

**Recommendation:**

Decrease `userStakeInformation` when unstaking tokens.
For example using an internal function to remove array element: 
```solidity
function removeArrayElement(uint poolId) internal {
           stakeInfo memory toDelete = userStakeInformation[msg.sender][poolId];
           for (uint256 i = 0; i < userStakeInformation[msg.sender].length; i++) {
               if (userStakeInformation[msg.sender][i].id == toDelete.id) {
                   userStakeInformation[msg.sender][i] = userStakeInformation[msg.sender][userStakeInformation[msg.sender].length - 1];
                   userStakeInformation[msg.sender].pop();
                   break;
               }
           }
       }

```


### Malicious Owner can set the fee to 100 percent and then withdraw the shares

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `setplatformFee` function in Treasury.sol allows setting a platform fee for a project without imposing any maximum limit. This poses a significant risk if the owner’s private key got leaked, a malicious owner could drain all the funds from the project. This lack of restriction can lead to setting excessively high platform fees, which could unfairly penalize investors and project owners.
```solidity
File: treasury.sol
1233:      function setplatformFee(uint projectId,uint _platformFee) external view { 
1234:       require(msg.sender==owner() || isOwner[msg.sender],"!Owner");
1235:         PlatformFee[projectId][_platformFee]; 
1236:         Whitelist memory users;
1237:         users.projectId=projectId;
1238:         users.platformFee=_platformFee;
1239:     }
```

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a maximum limit for the platform fee to ensure it remains within a reasonable range.

### Unrestricted Withdrawal of All Project Funds by Owner

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved


**Description**

The `withdrawAllFundsOfAProject` function in Treasury.sol allows the contract owners to withdraw all funds collected for a given project. This poses a significant risk if the owner’s private key got leaked, a malicious owner could drain all the funds from the project, potentially defrauding investors. The function does not currently implement any logic to restrict withdrawals to only the owner's share of the funds.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement logic to ensure that the owner can only withdraw their rightful share of the funds. The function should only allow withdrawal of the platform fees or other predetermined amounts that belong to the owner.


### Usage of native `transfer()`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

it was identified that the Treasury.sol, Vesting.sol and Staking.sol contracts uses the native `transfer()` function to transfer ETH, which could result in reverts. The `transfer()` only provides 2300 gas for its operation. This means the following cases can cause the transfer to fail: 

- The contract's callback spends more than 2300 gas (which is only enough to emit something) 

- The contract is called through a proxy which itself uses up the 2300 gas 

- complex operations or external calls

If a user falls into one of the above categories, they'll be unable to receive funds from the contract.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider using the low-level `.call()` instead of `transfer()`.



### Centralization Risk Due to Overpowered Owner

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Devve smart contracts grant significant control to the contract owners through several `onlyOwner` functions. This centralization poses a substantial risk, as it places considerable trust and control in a single entity. If the owner's private key is compromised, it could lead to catastrophic disruptions or malicious misuse of the contract. In recent history, similar centralization vulnerabilities have led to severe consequences, where the compromise of a single private key resulted in the loss of millions of dollars.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a multi-signature wallet for executing `onlyOwner` functions. This requires multiple authorized signatures to approve critical actions, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.




### Unchecked transfers return value in Vesting contract

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

ERC20 token transfers are performed using the `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods in `Vesting.sol` contract. These methods return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation, as per the ERC20 standard. However, the contract does not check these return values, which can lead to scenarios where token transfers fail silently. This can result in inconsistent contract states and potential loss of funds.

**Recommendation**: 

Use SafeERC20 library from OpenZeppelin, which handles these inconsistencies and ensures compatibility.

### Operation between two numbers based on different decimals.

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

In the `investInProjects()` function, `investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH` is set to `msg.value` which is 18 decimal.
But in the `refund()` function, `investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH` is substrated by an amount which is 6 decimal.

**Recommendation**: 

In the `refund()` function, if the currency is in ETH, then allow refunding the full `investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInETH` value or convert the amount refunded to a value with 18 decimal.

**Client comment**: team acknowledged this finding has this is only for native token, so this is disregarded for now

## Low Risk

### Setting storage variables in the constructor even if the contract is an upgradeable smart contract.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Setting storage variables in the constructor will not work for upgradeable contracts.
So `desinatedSigner` and `isOwner[msg.sender]` are set in the constructor of the treasury contract but they are only set on the logic contract. Not on the proxy contract.

**Recommendation:** 

Set the `desinatedSinger` and `isOwner[msg.sender]` in the `initialize()` function.


### Lack of Two-Step Ownership Transfer 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The devve contracts does not implement a two-step process for transferring ownership. In its current state, ownership can be transferred in a single step, which can be risky as it could lead to accidental or malicious transfers of ownership without proper verification.

**Recommendation**: 

Implement a two-step process for ownership transfer where the new owner must explicitly accept the ownership. This typically involves adding functions like `transferOwnership` and `acceptOwnership` or using OpenZeppelin’s Ownable2StepUpgradeable.



### Some conditions will only work with 18 decimals tokens 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The `upgradeStakeTokens()` function in `staking.sol` implements a require statement that checks the maximum number of staked tokens. This require statement assumes that the token used for staking is 18 decimals. However, as the protocol contains a function `setToken()` which allows the owner to change the token used for staking, including tokens with less or more than 18 decimals.

In a scenario where the token selected for staking is not 18 decimals the require statement will not work as expected.

**Recommendation:**

Use the `.decimals()` function instead of assuming 18.


### Missing Initialization of `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` In The Staking Contract and the treasury contract

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Staking contract and the treasury contract make use of the `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` dependency to handle violations of reentrancy; however, because the inherited contract is not initialized, `_status` will remain at zero rendering the inherited contract useless. This was rated as low in severity as tokens used related to the staking contract do not support the use of hooks and therefore reentrancy as it is, is low risk.

**Recommendation**: 

It’s recommended that `__ReentrancyGuard_init()` is called in the contract initializer. Upon initialization, this call to `__ReentrancyGuard_init()` will set `_status` to `_NOT_ENTERED` (or 1). 

### Checks, Effects & Interactions pattern not followed in the `unStake` function of `Staking.sol`

**Severity**: Low	

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `unStake()` and `unStakeByAdmin` functions in `staking.sol` are not following the check-effects-interactions pattern. These functions are executing external calls for transferring tokens before updating the contract state, more specifically, before deleting `userStakeInformation`. If the token used for staking is a token which implements hooks then a reentrancy attack could be executed within different functions or contracts. The `setToken()` function allows changing the token used for staking for a new one allowing the possibility of reentrancy takes place.

**Recommendation**:

Update every contract state before transferring tokens.


### Transfers can fail silently due to outdated ETH transfer method

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `staking.sol` contract executes several `transfer` and `transferFrom` calls without checking the return value and certain tokens transfer can fail without reverting. It is advisable to include a `require()` statement to verify the return value of token transfers or to use OpenZeppelin's `safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom`. Neglecting this can result in silent transfer failures and disrupt token accounting within the contract.

The contract also implements a `.transfer()` for transferring Ether which can also fail and not revert.

**Recommendation**:

Use `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer` instead. For the case of ETH transfer use `.call()` and add a `require` for checking the returned value.


### Owner can renounce ownership leaving the Treasury contract ownerless

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Ownable contracts includes a function named `renounceOwnership()` which can be used to remove the ownership of the contract. 
If this function is called on the Treasury.sol contract, it will result in the contract becoming disowned. This would subsequently break several critical functions of the protocol that rely on `onlyOwner` modifier.



**Recommendation**: override the function to disable its functionality, ensuring the contract cannot be disowned e.g.

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public override onlyOwner { 
revert ("renounceOwnership is disabled"); 
}
```
### Missing `_disableInitializers()` and possible initialization front-running

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The Treasury.sol contract is using the Initializable module and the constructor doesn’t call `_disableInitializers()`.  Also, the `initialize()` function doesn’t have access control to prevent front running attacks.

**Recommendation**: Consider calling `_disableInitializers()` in the constructor and add an `OnlyOwner` modifier to `initialize()`.

### Missing event emission in multiple functions at Treasury

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Multiple missing event emits are missing in Treasury.sol. Emitting events is crucial for tracking state changes and actions performed. Events provide a reliable way to monitor contract activity and are essential for debugging, auditing, and interacting with off-chain services. The treasury contract currently lacks event emissions in several functions, which makes it difficult to track important actions such as deposits, withdrawals, refunds, and ownership transfers. Examples of functions missing event emissions include:

`setUSDTAddress`
`setDesignatedSigner`
`setOwners`
`setplatformFee`



**Recommendation**: 

Define and emit appropriate events in each function to log significant actions and state changes.



### Missing event emission in multiple functions at Vesting

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Multiple missing event emits are missing in Vesting.sol. Emitting events is crucial for tracking state changes and actions performed. Events provide a reliable way to monitor contract activity and are essential for debugging, auditing, and interacting with off-chain services. The treasury contract currently lacks event emissions in several functions, which makes it difficult to track important actions such as deposits, withdrawals, refunds, and ownership transfers. Examples of functions missing event emissions include:

`setStartDate()`
`setToken()`
`addInvestorDetails()`
`transferOwnership()`



### Missing Sanity checks in multiple functions at Treasury

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

It was identified that multiple functions in Treasury.sol smart contract do not include checks to validate the provided parameters are not zero. Although this is not critical, failing to perform this validation can lead to unexpected behaviors
Examples of functions missing event emissions include:

`setUSDTAddress`
`setDesignatedSigner`
`setOwners`
`setplatformFee`

**Recommendation**: 

it is recommended to implement a check within these functions to ensure that the provided parameters are not zero.


### Missing Sanity checks in multiple functions at Vesting

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

It was identified that multiple functions in Vesting.sol smart contract does not include checks to validate the provided parameters are not zero. Although this is not critical, failing to perform this validation can lead to unexpected behaviors
Examples of functions missing event emissions include:

`setToken()`
`transferOwnership()`


**Recommendation**: 

it is recommended to implement a check within these functions to ensure that the provided parameters are not zero.



## Informational

### Missing `ReentrancyGuards` in Vesting can increase risk of recursive programming used maliciously

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

The team noticed that Vesting.sol smart contract is not upgradable and it inherits the upgradable version of reentrancy guard.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider inheriting `ReentrancyGuard` instead of `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`.



### `StakesPerUser` is not decreased when unstaking

**Severity**: Informational	

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The variable `StakesPerUser` is increased each time a user stakes but it is not decreased after unstaking tokens.

**Client comment**: 

Team said that this is the expected behavior, it neither implies security risks now as `stakeLength()` function was removed.


### Lack of testing

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

The codebase lacks test cases. Comprehensive unit and integration tests are essential for identifying bugs and logic errors early in the development process. Projects should aim for extensive coverage, addressing both invalid inputs and typical use cases. This practice will significantly boost confidence in the code's functionality for both users and developers.

**Recommendation:** 

Consider adding tests to the codebase.


### Read storage variables multiple times.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the `refundFromAdminInUSDT()` function, the function reads `investorInvestedAmountPerProjectInUSDT` multiple times from storage in the same iteration of the for loop.

**Recommendation**: 

Add a local variable instead of reading the storage variable multiple times.


### Unnecessary require statement

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the `investInProjects()` function, if the currency is not in ETH, there is a check if `whichCurreny` is 2. But `whichCurreny[msg.sender][users.projectId]` will never be 2.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the require check.


### Wrong comment.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the vesting contract, the comment for `vestingPeriodDays` says 10 months * 30 days but the variable is set to 12 * 30 which is 12 months.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the comment to 12 months.


### Wrong error message.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In the `addAirdrop()` function of the vesting contract, it checks if the caller has already been added but the error message is wrong.

**Recommendation**: 

Change the message to read “User already added”.

### Custom Ownership Transfer Logic

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contract includes custom functions for 2 step ownership transfer, which adds unnecessary complexity. Instead, the contract should inherit from `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` to leverage well-audited and standardized 2 step ownership transfer functionalities.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the custom ownership transfer logic and inherit from `Ownable2StepUpgradeable`.

### Use `onlyOwner` Modifier instead of requiring checks

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The contract uses custom ownership verification logic with
 `require(msg.sender == owner() || isOwner[msg.sender], "!Owner");`
in multiple functions like `withdrawAdminShare()`, `settleProjectOwnerFunds` and `withdrawAllFundsOfAProject`. This adds unnecessary complexity. The contract should instead use the `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure only the owner can call these functions.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the custom ownership verification logic and use the `onlyOwner` modifier.
