# Findings

## Medium Risk


### Malicious user can front-run trades and deposit USDC tokens on behalf of other user

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `buyOption` and `sellOption` functions allow a user to deposit USDC along with the trade execution. However, the deposit_amount parameter is not a part of the provided signatures. If the user has previously given the contract approval to spend their USDC, an attacker can front-run the user's transaction, setting the deposit_amount to any value up to the total USDC amount the user has approved the contract to spend, decreased by usdc_cost. As a result, users may unintentionally deposit funds without their explicit consent and knowledge.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider allowing the deposit of USDC tokens only if the user is equal to `msg.sender`.

## Low Risk

### Use of single step ownership transfer

**Severity**: Low

**Status**:  Acknowledged

**Description**

The Exchange contract uses the OwnableUpgradeable contract which allows changing the owner address. If the adminâ€™s address is set incorrectly, this could potentially result in critical functionalities becoming locked.

**Recommendation**: 

Consider implementing a two-step pattern. Utilize OpenZeppelin's Ownable2StepUpgradeable contract.

## Informational

### Missing disable initializer

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Contract Exchange.sol inherits the Intializable.sol and implements the initialize(...) method with the initializer modifier without disabling the initializers for the implementation contract as recommended by OpenZeppelin here.

**Recommendation**: 

Disable the initializers for the implementation method as suggested by OpenZeppelin here.

### Use specific Solidity compiler version

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Audited contracts use the following floating pragma:
pragma solidity ^0.7.6;

It allows to compile contracts with various versions of the compiler and introduces the risk of using a different version when deploying than during testing.

**Recommendation**: 

Use a specific version of the Solidity compiler.
