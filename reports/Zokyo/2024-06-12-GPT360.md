# Findings

## Low Risk

### Centralization Risk Due to Whole Total Supply Minted to One Wallet

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

On deployment, the entire total supply of the token is minted to a single wallet. This poses a centralization risk as it gives one wallet complete control over the entire asset. This concentration of power can lead to trust issues and potential misuse of tokens.

**Recommendation**: 

To mitigate this centralization risk, consider transferring the tokens to a multisig wallet, which requires multiple approvals for transactions, thereby distributing the control. Additionally, implementing a vesting schedule for the tokens would ensure that not all tokens are available for use immediately, which can help in maintaining stability and reducing risks associated with large, single-point control.

**Client comment**: tokens will get locked closer to IDO and vested accordingly



## Informational

### Floating Pragma 


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The `Gpt360TokenOneChain.sol` smart contract uses a floating pragma version (^0.8.0). Contracts should be deployed using the same compiler version and settings as were used during development and testing. Locking the pragma version helps ensure that contracts are not inadvertently deployed with a different compiler version.


**Recommendation**: 

Consider locking the pragma version to a specific, tested version to ensure consistent compilation and behavior of the smart contract.
