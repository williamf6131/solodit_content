# Findings

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Insufficient input validation

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as it can lead to stuck funds

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a bad user error

**Description**

In `GNSStakingV6_4_1::createUnlockSchedule` we have the `UnlockScheduleInput calldata _input` parameter, where most of the fields in the struct are properly validated to be in range of valid values. The issue is that the `start` field of the `UnlockScheduleInput` is not sufficiently validated, as it can be too further away in the future - for example 50 years in the future, due to a user error when choosing the timestamp. This would result in (almost) permanent lock of the `GNS` funds sent to the method.

**Recommendations**

Add a validation that the `start` field is not too further away in the future, for example it should be max 1 year in the future.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Implementation contract can be initialized

The `GNSStakingV6_4_1` is an implementation contract that is expected to be used through a proxy. Since implementation contracts shouldn't be used, it is a convention to disallow their initialization. Consider adding an empty constructor that calls `_disableInitializers()` in `GNSStakingV6_4_1`.

### [L-02] Use a two-step access control transfer pattern

The `GNSStakingV6_4_1::setGovFund` uses a single-step access control transfer pattern. This means that if the current `govFund` account calls `setGovFund` with an incorrect address, then this `govFund` role will be lost forever along with all the functionality that depends on it. Follow the pattern from OpenZeppelin's [Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) and implement a two-step transfer pattern for the action.
