## High Risk

### [C-01] Recoveries of type `SigMode.OnlyDKIM` can be reverted by anyone

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as the recovery will be reverted and the user still won't be able to gain access to his smart wallet

**Likelihood:**
High, as anyone can execute this attack when `SigMode.OnlyDKIM` is used for recovery

**Description**

The way in which the recoveries in `DKIMRecoverySigValidator::validateSig` work are that when a recovery is executed, the `sigMeta.newAddressToSet` address will be granted `sigMeta.newPrivilegeValue` privileges. In `AmbireAccount` when an address has non-zero privileges he is allowed to execute anything in the smart wallet, making him an owner of it. The problem with this is that the `sigMeta.newPrivilegeValue` is not validated.

If a user uses a recovery of type `SigMode.OnlyDKIM` and sends a recovery transaction to set address "X" to have privilege of "1", now a timelock will be set, after which the user can send the same transaction again and the "X" address will have a privilege of "1". Now it is possible that a malicious attacker uses the same transaction payload that the user used but just by changing the `data` of the first `Transaction` in the `calls` argument in `DKIMRecoverySigValidator::validateSig` and setting the `sigMeta.newPrivilegeValue` to 0, now a new recovery will be started which will set the "X" address so that it doesn't have privileges anymore. This will work as the `identifier` for the recovery will be different, since `sigMeta` is part of the `identifier` calculation and is now different.

There are variations of this attack - the malicious user can back-run the normal user's `SigMode.OnlyDKIM` transaction, so he will be able to execute his timelock just after the user does.

[Here is a Github gist link](https://gist.github.com/pashov/f154ecb2be94e672324e9df122e15617) to a Proof of Concept unit test to see the attack in action (you can put it in the `'DKIM sigMode OnlyDKIM'` suite in `DKIMTest.ts` to run it).

**Recommendations**

For recoveries only allow `sigMeta.newPrivilegeValue == 1` or remove `sigMeta.newPrivilegeValue` from the `identifier` construction.

### [C-02] Recoveries can be blocked by front-running

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as recovery functionality won't be usable

**Likelihood:**
High, as there are no preconditions to executing such an attack on all recoveries

**Description**

Each call from `AmbireAccount` to `DKIMRecoverySigValidator::validateSig` can be front-runned by calling the method with the same arguments, which will set the value in the `recoveries` mapping for the recovery payload to `true`, making the actual transaction revert due to this check:

```solidity
require(!recoveries[identifier], 'recovery already done');
```

[Here is a Github gist link](https://gist.github.com/pashov/6f85756cca9aedfb059f082e71e138c7) to a Proof of Concept unit test to see the attack in action (you can put it in the `'DKIM sigMode Both'` suite in `DKIMTest.ts` to run it).

**Recommendations**

In `validateSig` just use `msg.sender` instead of the `accountAddress` parameter. This will prevent anyone from sending the `accountAddress` to be the `AmbireAccount` one.

### [C-03] Anyone can block single signature DKIM recoveries

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as the user won't be able to recover access to his wallet

**Likelihood:**
High, as anyone can execute this attack by front-running a recovery

**Description**

In `DKIMRecoverySigValidator` there is a mechanism for single signature recoveries. The catch is that if you use it, you will have to have a timelock on your recovery, which is a predefined number (should be set in `AccInfo.onlyOneSigTimelock`). Until a timelock expires the wallet access can't be recovered. The problem here is that the `checkTimelock` method that actually sets a lock for an `identifier` (which is built by hashing some recovery data) is `public`, so anyone can call it. This means that anyone can front-run a `validateSig` call with a `checkTimelock` one, setting a huge `time` until unlock of the recovery, basically blocking it.

[Here is a Github gist link](https://gist.github.com/pashov/8a9956d918045c73425177600c497ac2) to a Proof of Concept unit test to see the attack in action (you can put it in the `'DKIM sigMode OnlySecond with a timelock of 2 minutes'` suite in `DKIMTest.ts` to run it).

**Recommendations**

Change the `checkTimelock` method from `public` to `private` so it can only be called internally by `validateSig`, or just inline the method.

### [H-01] Recoveries of type `SigMode.OnlySecond` can be endlessly replayed

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as it can result in a loss of wallet access

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it requires specific conditions but they can happen even after years of using the wallet

**Description**

The `recoveries` mapping in `DKIMRecoverySigValidator` is serving as a way to check if a `recovery` has been executed already, so it is a way to block recovery replays. The problem with this is that the key in that mapping is calculated from fields in a recovery payload that can be slightly changed (for example by adding a random character to a `string` or `bytes` typed field, examples are `SignatureMeta.canonizedHeaders` or `SignatureMeta.key.pubKeyModulus`) so you can execute a recovery payload where all other values are the same.

The concrete problem is here:

```solidity
bytes32 identifier = keccak256(abi.encode(accountAddr, data, sigMeta));
```

The `identifier` which is used as a key in the `recoveries` mapping, is using `SignatureMeta sigMeta` which has the `string canonizedHeaders` field. When `SigMode.OnlySecond` is used, the `canonizedHeaders` has no validation whatsoever, so it can be slightly changed and the `identifier` would be different, while all other values are the same and still valid. This means that all `SigMode.OnlySecond` recoveries can be replayed endlessly - as many times as desired, forever.

The problem is deflated by the fact that the `SignatureMeta.newKeyToSet` value can't be changed (it is validated when `SigMode.onlySecond` is used), so all of the mentioned replays will end up granting access to the same `newKeyToSet` address every time they are executed. Still, let's look at the following scenario:

1. Alice lost access to her `AmbireAccount` so she executes a recovery using `DKIMRecoverySigValidator` with `SigMode.OnlySecond`, which gives control over her `AmbireAccount` to the address she set in `SignatureMeta.newKeyToSet`
2. A year passes by, Alice rotates her keys and now throws away the old ones
3. Bob replays her previous recovery by slightly changing the `canonizedHeaders` field which results in that same address (which Alice now doesn't control) to control her `AmbireAccount`
4. Now Alice has lost control over her wallet and can't recover it, since the recovery is configured to work only for the previously set `SignatureMeta.newKeyToSet`

**Recommendations**

When crafting the `identifier` key for the `recoveries` mapping, possibly use only the fields from `SignatureMeta` that are validated in all code paths, so that recovery replays are not possible.


## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Insufficient input validation

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as it can result in forever blocked recoveries or wallet access loss

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires user error when configuring their recovery

**Description**

The `DKIMRecoverySigValidator` contract uses the `AccInfo` struct that has fields which values are not validated. Here are the fields that are problematic:

- `secondaryKey` can be the zero address, which can result in a loss of access to the `AmbireAccount` wallet
- `waitUntilAcceptAdded` is a time value and can be too big, resulting in inability to add DKIM keys
- `waitUntilAcceptRemoved` is a time value and can be too big, resulting in inability to remove DKIM keys
- `onlyOneSigTimelock` is a time value and can be too big, resulting in forever locked recovery

**Recommendations**

Add sensible upper boundaries for the time values and a check that `secondaryKey != address(0)`.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] The `dateRemoved` field of a removed DKIM key can be reset

The `removeDKIMKey` method in `DKIMRecoverySigValidator` does not check if the given key has already been removed. The `authorizedToRevoke` account can call the method for the same key as many times as he wants, which will reset the `dateRemoved` property to `block.timestamp` each time.

### [L-02] Validate the `to` email as you do for the `from` one

In `DKIMRecoverySigValidator::_verifyHeaders` the `from` mail is validated in a way that protects from the email that looks like "fake@gmail.com@gmail.com". The check is not done for the `to` mail and can be added by slicing the string up until the special character that is expected to be after the email, and comparing this to `toHeader`.
