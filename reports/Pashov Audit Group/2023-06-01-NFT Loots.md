## High Risk

### [C-01] Polygon chain reorgs will often change game results

**Impact:**
High, as an already winning user will lose its reward

**Likelihood:**
High, as reorgs with > 3 depth happen often on Polygon

**Description**

The `REQUEST_CONFIRMATION` constant in `VRFv2Consumer` is set to 3. This value is used to tell the Chainlink VRF service how much blocks do you want to wait at a minimum before receiving randomness. The reason this value was added is because of chain reorganizations - when this event happens, blocks and transactions get reorganized and they change. This is a serious problem in this application as it is expected to be launched on Polygon (mentioned in `README.md`), but as we can see [here](https://polygonscan.com/blocks_forked) there are more than 5 block reorganizations a day with depth that is more than 3 blocks. In [this article](https://protos.com/polygon-hit-by-157-block-reorg-despite-hard-fork-to-reduce-reorgs/) we can even see a recent event where there was a 156 block depth chain reorg on Polygon. This means that it is possible that often the winner of a lootbox game to be changed since when your transaction for requesting randomness from VRF is moved to a different block then the randomness will change as well.

**Recommendations**

Use a larger `REQUEST_CONFIRMATIONS` value - I would suggest around 60 to be safe. For the past 7 days the deepest chain reorganization had a depth of < 30 blocks. While 60 might not fit your use case for the game, I think anything below 25-30 is potentially dangerous to the project's users and reputation.

## High Risk

### [H-01] Contract might not have enough balance for winner to claim prize

**Impact:**
High, as user will not be able to claim prize value

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it requires the owner to not input enough balance

**Description**

The protocol doesn't enforce the actual balance in the `NFTLootbox` contract to be enough to pay out rewards. The first issue comes in the `createLootbox` method, where the code does

```solidity
loot.usdPrizes = prizes;
```

but it doesn't actually transfer `prizes` amount of stablecoin into the contract - it just expects it will have it as a balance, which is not enforcing it and is error-prone. Also, the contract is expected to hold the value of each NFT supplied as reward also in its USD value. So if a BAYC NFT was deposited as a reward, not only the BAYC should be held by the contract but also its USD value in stablecoin. Even though winners will be able to claim either the NFT itself or its USD value, this way the capital efficiency gets cut in half. This is also not enforced.

The situation currently is that the contract is not trustless - there might not be enough rewards to pay winners.

**Recommendations**

Ensure that all rewards possible to be won are claimable all of the time in a trustless manner. Enforce the contract to hold at least as much balance as the sum of all possible rewards.

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Two people might win the same prize

**Impact:**
High, as people might not get their prizes

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires same `prizeIndex` wins

**Description**

The current way in `NFTLootbox` to decide if a player wins and what it wins is the `getPrizeIndex` method, which has the following implementation:

```solidity
uint256[] storage _probabilities = lootboxes[_lootboxId].probabilities;
uint256 sum;

// Calculate the cumulative sum of probabilities and find the winning prize
for (uint256 i; i < _probabilities.length; ++i) {
    sum += _probabilities[i];
    if (_randomNumber <= sum) {
        return i;
    }
}

// If no prize is won, return a missing prize index (100001)
return MAX_PROBABILITY + 1;
```

This shows that the smaller `randomNumber` you get, the bigger chance you have of winning. The flaw is that multiple people might draw a small `randomNumber` and get the same `prizeIndex` returned, resulting in them being able to claim the same reward. This is also amplified by the fact that the `probabilities` array is not enforced to be sorted - if the first values in the `probabilities` array are big then it is more possible that winners will get the same `prizeIndex` and prize.

While the game currently looks like it handles this, as multiple users can claim the same prize with the same `prizeIndex`, this shouldn't be the case, as it means there is a race condition for the first person to get an NFT's `prizeIndex`, because front-running can be used to get the ERC721 token from another winner even if you played later than him (given that you got the same `prizeIndex` win). Also, if it is a USD based prize, then it is possible that multiple people win it but it is not enforced that the contract has this balance. This can mean some people lose their expected rewards.

**Recommendations**

Enforce only 1 winner per `prizeIndex` and also enforce the `probabilities` array to be sorted.

### [M-02] Some common non-standard ERC20 tokens are incompatible with the protocol

**Impact:**
Medium, because it won't leave to a loss of funds, outside of gas for redeployment

**Likelihood:**
Medium, because such token is listed in the docs

**Description**

The code in `NFTLootbox` is directly using ERC20's `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods. There are two problems with this:

1. Some tokens do not revert on failure in `transfer` or `transferFrom`, but instead return false (example is `ZRX`)
2. Some tokens do not return a bool on `transfer` or `transferFrom` call (examples are `USDT`, `BNB`, `OMG`).

The application is incompatible with either of those. The more problematic one is `USDT` as it is widely known that it has those flaws and it is actually directly listed in the documentation. Still, by looking at the [implementation code](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xba2a995bd4ab9e605454ccef88169352cd5f75a6#code) of the `USDT` token on Polygon, which is different from the Ethereum one, it looks like the issue is not present there. This is why this issue is only marked as Medium severity, but it still requires handling to be extra safe.

**Recommendations**

Use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library and its `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` methods.

### [M-03] Lootbox input validation should be present

**Impact:**
High, as it can leave NFTs stuck in the contract forever

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a fat-finger or misconfiguration by the `NFTLootbox` owner

**Description**

Both the `_priceForPlay` and `_duration` values should be properly validated in `NFTLootbox::createLootbox`. The `_priceToPlay` has to have an upper bound, because if it's too big then no one will want to participate and until the duration passes the NFTs will be stuck in the contract. For the `_duration` value there should be a lower and an upper bound, as too low of a duration doesn't make sense but too big of a duration can leave NFTs stuck in the contract forever. If the owner fat-fingers the duration and adds one or two digits it can become a big problem.

**Recommendations**

Add a lower & upper bound checks for `_duration` and a max value check for `_priceForPlay` in the `createLootbox` method.

### [M-04] Centralization attack vectors are present in the code

**Impact:**
High, as some accounts can execute a rug pull or brick the game

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malicious or compromised owner/admin account

**Description**

The owner accounts of both `NFTLootbox` & `VRFv2Consumer` contracts have the power to break the game while it is running.

- `NFTLootbox::withdrawERC20` can be used by the contract owner to execute a rug pull by withdrawing all of the reward tokens from the contract
- `NFTLootbox::withdrawERC721` can be used to steal the ERC721 tokens if the lootbox has closed but the game winner is still about to claim them
- `VRFv2Consumer::requestRandomWords` should only be callable by `NFTLootbox` - currently it can be forbidden that it is called from `NFTLootbox`, resulting in a DoS in a running game
- `NFTLootbox::changeVrfV2Consumer` can be used maliciously to update the randomness provider to an admin controlled one
- `NFTLootbox::changeBetCoin` shouldn't be callable while a game is running as if it's not a stablecoin then the `priceForPlay` will be very different

**Recommendations**

Limit the usage of those methods by either making them callable only in special conditions or with specific arguments.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Contract can't receive NFTs sent with `safeTransferFrom` method

The `NFTLootbox` contract is expected to receive and hold ERC721 tokens, but some smart wallets or contracts send an nft using `safeTransferFrom` which checks for the `onERC721Received` method if the recipient is a contract. Make sure to extend `ERC721Holder` from OpenZeppelin to handle this.
