## High Risk

### [C-01] Anyone can cancel another user's scheduled recovery

**Impact:**
High, as important protocol feature can be permanently blocked for a victim user

**Likelihood:**
High, as it has no preconditions and can be exploited by anyone

**Description**

A wallet recovery mechanism in Ambire allows a pre-set account (usually the relayer) to set a new main signer after the initial one was stolen/lost. It works by calling `execute` with a `SIGMODE_RECOVER` signature. This will store the request in the contract like this, scheduling it for the future:

```solidity
scheduledRecoveries[hash] = block.timestamp + recoveryInfo.timelock;
emit LogRecoveryScheduled(hash, recoveryInfoHash, recoveryKey, currentNonce, block.timestamp, txns);
```

The contract also allows an option to cancel a scheduled recovery, by using a `SIGMODE_CANCEL` signature. The problem is that the `hash` that is stored as a scheduled recovery does not contain the `isCancellation` flag (which just checks if the signature mode is `SIGMODE_CANCEL`). Since the flag isn't part of this hash, anyone can call `execute` with the same `signature` parameter as when `SIGMODE_RECOVER` was used, but just changing the last byte so it uses `SIGMODE_CANCEL`. This means that anyone can cancel another user's scheduled recovery without any preconditions, which leads to a griefing attack vector on wallet recoveries. An attacker can go to an extend to write a script that will cancel a scheduled recovery a few minutes before it is about to pass.

**Recommendations**

Add the `isCancellation` flag to the `hash` so that the initial `SIGMODE_RECOVER` signature can't be changed into a `SIGMODE_CANCEL` one and reused.

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Invalid signature execution is possible if `address(0)` has non-zero privileges

**Impact:**
High, as anyone will be able to steal all funds from a given wallet

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires `address(0)` to have non-zero privileges

**Description**

The problem is similar to [this](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire-findings/issues/13) issue from a previous audit. The code in `SignatureValidator::recoverAddrImpl` will return `address(0)` if it receives a valid `Schnorr` signature but not one that is for the given `hash` (transactions hash). Now the result will be checked like this:

```solidity
signerKey = SignatureValidator.recoverAddrImpl(hash, signature, true);
require(privileges[signerKey] != bytes32(0), 'INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGE');
```

Meaning `signerKey` will be `address(0)` and now if the value for `privileges[address(0)]` is non-zero, then anyone will be able to execute any transaction for this wallet, for example stealing all funds.

Also, it is possible to get `recoverAddrImpl` to return `address(0)` if you provide a signature with `SignatureMode == Multisig` and then the signatures inside it to be of type `SignatureMode == Spoof`. Since `allowSpoofing` argument will be `false`, then we will get to the `return address(0);` code in the end of the method.

A third way to get `recoverAddrImpl` to return `address(0)` is if you use `SignatureMode == Multisig` and just provide an empty array of signatures - then it will return the default value of `address signer` which is `address(0)`

**Recommendations**

Make sure to never have a path where `recoverAddrImpl` returns `address(0)`, instead just revert the transaction. Also remove the comment `// should be impossible to get here` as it is false.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] The `ecrecover` precompile is vulnerable to signature malleability

By flipping `s` and `v` it is possible to create a different signature that will amount to the same hash & signer. This is fixed in OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library like [this](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/dfef6a68ee18dbd2e1f5a099061a3b8a0e404485/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol#L125-L136). While this is not a problem since there are nonces in the system signatures, it is still highly recommended that problem is addressed.

### [L-02] Schnorr signatures are insufficiently validated

As per [Chainlink's Schnorr signatures verification implementation](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/bb214c5d7ec172de400a72a1d8851ff639c979d2/evm/v0.5/contracts/dev/SchnorrSECP256K1.sol#L107-L109) it is recommended to check that the Schnorr signature is strongly less than the `Q` constant as well as the public key's X coordinate to be less than `Q/2`. This protects from signature malleability attacks which are not currently a problem in the system because there are nonces in the signatures.

### [L-03] Not all call paths are anti-bricking protected

Both the `execute` and `executeBySender` call paths have anti-bricking protection that looks like:

```solidity
require(privileges[signerKey] != bytes32(0), 'PRIVILEGE_NOT_DOWNGRADED');
```

and

```solidity
require(privileges[msg.sender] != bytes32(0), 'PRIVILEGE_NOT_DOWNGRADED');
```

The problem is that the `fallback` call path is missing this protection, which means not 100% of cases are covered. A possible partial solution is to check if the caller's privileges were downgraded in the `delegatecall` and if they were to revert. Still, not all cases can be handled properly here, so document this well when explaining the expected fallback handler behavior.

### [L-04] Signature expiry is not implemented in the protocol

Let's say a user signs a bundle of transactions and expects the relayer to execute it, including a tip for him. Now if the gas price spikes up very quickly it can become not economically viable for the relayer to execute the bundle, so the transaction might stay stale for a while. When the gas price falls back the market could have changed, which can result in for example swaps receiving less value than they should have. To combat this it is useful to add a signature expiry/deadline property, after which a bundle would be invalid to execute.
