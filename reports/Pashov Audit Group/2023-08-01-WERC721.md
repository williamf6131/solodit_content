# Findings

## Low Risk

### [L-01] No way to get ETH out of proxy

The proxy pattern used implements a `receive() payable` method (can be seen [here](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/2cfa231273fea6872c7cb70acfa134d2199aa7ea/src/utils/LibClone.sol#L337-L349)), but there is no way to get the received ETH out of the proxy, as the implementation contract that it `delegatecall`s to (`WERC721`) does not have a method to withdraw ETH out of it. Since the proxy is not expected to receive ETH this is not a High Impact issue, but it can still be worth it to add a `withdrawETH` method.

### [L-02] Some contracts might not be able to handle `WERC721` tokens

The `ERC721` standard added the `safeTransferFrom` functionality because there can be smart contract accounts that do not expect to receive such tokens and can't handle (move) them. The same problem exists for `WERC721`, as a smart contract might not be able to call `transfer` or `unwrap`. A possible solution is the same mechanism as `ERC721`.

### [L-03] Bytecode might not be compatible with all EVM-based chains

The protocol is expected to be deployed on multiple EVM-based chains (Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon etc) but the `pragma` statement shows usage of 0.8.21 version of the Solidity compiler. This version (and every version after 0.8.19) will use the `PUSH0` opcode, which is still not supported on some EVM-based chains, for example Arbitrum. Consider using version 0.8.19 so that the same deterministic bytecode can be deployed to all chains.

### [L-04] Timestamp comparison has a logical error

In `WERC721::transferFromWithAuthorization` we see the following code:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < validAfter) revert InvalidTransferAuthorization();
if (block.timestamp > validBefore)
    revert InvalidTransferAuthorization();
```

There is a logical error there, as even though the variable is named `validAfter`, the value of the variable would still work as a valid timestamp for transfer. Example is if the code says "validAfter = 12:00:00 PM" and then you pas 12:00:00 it should fail, as it should be only valid "after", but with the current code it will work. Change `<` to `<=` and `>` to `>=`.
