# Findings

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Protocol will not be compatible with commonly used ERC20 tokens

**Severity**

**Impact:**
Medium, as it most probably won't result in value loss but it limits the protocol usability

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it will not work with some commonly used tokens, but will work with others

**Description**

Here is a code snippet from `PumpV1::fulfill`:

```solidity
if (order.isBuy) {
    ERC20(order.baseToken).transferFrom(order.maker, msg.sender, baseTokenAmount - fee);
    ERC20(order.baseToken).transferFrom(order.maker, owner(), fee);
    Token(order.assetToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, order.recipient, amount);
} else {
    ERC20(order.baseToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, order.recipient, baseTokenAmount - fee);
    ERC20(order.baseToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), fee);
    Token(order.assetToken).transferFrom(order.maker, msg.sender, amount);
}
```

The code is calling the `transferFrom` method of the `ERC20` implementation (`ERC20` imported from the `solady` dependency), which expects a `bool` return value. Tokens like `USDT`, `BNB` and others are missing a return value on `transfer` and `transferFrom`, which would break integration with the application. There are also tokens that do not revert on failure in transfer but return a `false` boolean value like `EURS`. You can read more about such tokens [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20).

Another issue is that the math to compute `baseTokenAmount` and `fee` in the `fulfill` method of `PumpV1` rely on the `baseToken` decimals to be exactly 18, since the code is using wad-based math when calculating `baseTokenAmount` and `fee`. Many commonly used tokens have lower than 18 decimals (`USDC` and `USDT` have 6 decimals) and some tokens have more than 18 decimals (`YAM-V2` has 24 decimals). While lower decimal tokens transactions can at most revert, the high decimal token transactions can possibly lead to more tokens spent from a user than what he intended.

**Recommendations**

Use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library and its `safeTransferFrom` method to handle such tokens. Also scale all token amounts to 18 decimals or forbid using non-18 decimals tokens in the application with an explicit check in `fulfill`.

### [M-02] Fee can be set to 100% before order fulfillment

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as it can mean the order recipient will receive nothing in exchange for his tokens

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malicious or compromised admin

**Description**

The `setFeeRate` method in `PumpV1` currently has no input validation on the `_feeRate` parameter. If the value given is `1e18` this would set the fee to 100%. An admin can see a call to `fulfill` by monitoring the blockchain's pending transaction pool and front-run it by setting the fee to 100%, essentially stealing all of the tokens that the order recipient should have gotten.

**Recommendations**

Limit the fee rate to have a maximum value, for example 3%.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] No input validation on the vesting duration setter

The `setVestingDuration` method in `PumpV1` has no input validation, meaning it allows the protocol owner to set any value as `vestingDuration`. There are two potential problems with this - using the value of 0, which would lead to DoS of the protocol, because division by zero reverts the transaction, and using a too big of a value which would make the vesting rate of a user to be 0. Implement lower and upper bounds for the `vestingDuration` value.

### [L-02] Cancellation can be front-run

The `PumpV1` contract implements a `cancel` method which allows an order maker to cancel his order. The problem is that anyone can see a call to `cancel` and front-run the transaction with a call to `fulfill`, essentially executing the order and not allowing the order maker to cancel it. Consider adding this to your documentation or allowing some other approach for order cancellation.
