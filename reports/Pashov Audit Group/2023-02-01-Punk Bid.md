# Findings

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Protocol expecting a 0 `wei` Punk sale offer is risky

The `acceptBid` function expects that the Punk for sale has a market sell offer for 0 `wei`. In [CryptoPunksMarket](https://github.com/larvalabs/cryptopunks/blob/11532167fa705ced569fc3206df0484f9027e1ee/contracts/CryptoPunksMarket.sol) there are two methods to create a sell offer for your Punk: `offerPunkForSale` and `offerPunkForSaleToAddress`. By using the former your offer can be accepted by anyone on the market and by using the latter your offer can be accepted only by the `toAddress` argument you sent.

It is crucial here that the front-end and the users who interact with the protocol directly on-chain should use the `offerPunkForSaleToAddress` method and the `toAddress` argument should be the address of the `PunkBidMarketV1` contract. If `offerPunkForSale` is used with a 0 `wei` offer then bots will immediately back-run the offer and snipe the Punk. This came to my attention because actually the `ICryptoPunksMarket` interface as well as the unit tests of `PunkBidMarketV1` use the `offerPunkForSale` method which is incorrect. Update the interface and tests to use the `offerPunkForSaleToAddress` method and also make sure this is well documented in the NatSpec of `acceptBid` and for the front-end to use the `offerPunkForSaleToAddress` method.

### [L-02] Bid expiration is not constrained

The `enterBid` method is missing input validation on the `expiration` argument so it is possible to enter an already expired bid or a bid that is never expiring. Another thing is that the `updateBids` method allows an already expired bid to be updated. While currently this results only in some used up storage and events emitted, it is recommended to do input sanitization so that only valid bids are accepted in the system. Consider adding lower and upper constraints, for example

```solidity
require(expiration > block.timestamp && expiration < block.timestamp + 365 days);
```

## Informational

### [I-01] The `withdraw` method can be permissionless

Instead of using the `onlyOwner` modifier on `withdraw`, just replace `msg.sender` with `owner` as the callee and remove the modifier. This will save some gas and remove any access controls in the protocol, making it completely permissionless.

### [I-02] Change `FEE` to a constant

Currently the `FEE` variable is `immutable` even though its value is known before deployment. It is more correct to use a `constant` here and you can also make it a `private` one since its value is not expected to be read on-chain and is easily visible off-chain by looking at the source code.
