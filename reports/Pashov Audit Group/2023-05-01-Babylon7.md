## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Protocol admin account has a large centralization attack surface

**Impact:**
High, as creators can lose their raffled items and payouts

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malicious or a compromised admin

**Description**

A malicious or a compromised admin can execute various rug-like attacks on the protocol:

1. Upgrading the `Babylon7Core` contract to add code to exploit creator's allowances so their raffled items are stolen by the protocol owner
2. Setting the `_treasury` address to one without a `payable` `fallback` or `receive` method (for example `address(0)`), resulting in an inability for the `listing.creator` to execute a `transferETHToCreator` transaction
3. Setting an owner-controlled random provider at any time, so controlling who the winner of a raffle is

There are also smaller problems, like:

1. Setting a very small `_maxListingDuration`
2. Setting a very large `_minDonationBps` (both in `initialize` and in `setMinDonationBps`)
3. The `core` address can be changed in `RandomProvider` which can allow for direct calls to `requestRandom`

**Recommendations**

Use a TimeLock contract to be the protocol owner, so users can actually monitor protocol upgrades or other actions by the admins. Another option is to make the admin a governance controlled address.

Also you should use a `MINIMUM_MAX_LISTING_DURATION` constant and validate the `maxListingDuration` value in `setMaxListingDuration`, doing the same with a `MAXIMUM_MIN_DONATION_BPS` constant in both `initialize` and `setMinDonationBps` for the `minDonationBps` value. Finally, the `setBabylon7Core` should be made so it is called only once and `core` can't be changed later.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Not following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern

In `transferETHToCreator`, even though there is a `nonReentrant` modifier, the CEI pattern is not followed. The `listing.state = ListingState.Finalized;` code is executed after the ether transfers. It is recommended to always first change the state before doing external calls - while the code is not vulnerable right now due to the `nonReentrant` modifier, it is still a best practice to be followed.

### [L-02] The cached request should be deleted on randomness received

In `RandomProvider::fulfillRandomWords` it is checked that `requests[_requestId].exists == true`. This is correct, but then after the request is fulfilled (as the name of the event emitted in the method) the request value should be deleted from the mapping, so it doesn't exist anymore.

```diff
        require(requests[_requestId].exists, 'RandomProvider: requestId not found');
        _core.resolveClaimer(requests[_requestId].listingId, randomWords[0]);
        emit RequestFulfilled(_requestId, requests[_requestId].listingId, randomWords);
+       delete requests[_requestId];
```

### [L-03] Pull over push pattern is preferred in Solidity

The `resolveClaimer` method in `Babylon7Core` uses a "push" pattern to force-transfer the ERC721/ERC1155 item to the raffle winner. This opens up some attack vectors like gas griefing, force reverts and callbacks, because of the `safeTransferFrom` methods. It is recommended to use a pull over push approach, where the winner would have to send a transaction to claim the item himself.

### [L-04] The `minDonationBps` variable needs an upper bound

Neither in `initialize` nor in `setMinDonationBps` is the `minDonationBps` value checked that it is not `> BASIS_POINTS`, which allows the owner (either maliciously or by mistake) to make it so that

### [L-05] Enum used in a struct should have an invalid default element

Currently the default value for `_listingInfos[id].state` is `ListingState.Active` even if the `id` is non-existent. This opens up a vulnerability, as `Active` is both used for a non-existing listing and for an active one. While the code is not vulnerable due to other present checks, it's correct to use an `ListingState.Inactive` as the default value for listings, so it should be added as the first enum element.

can a listing creator buy tickets for a raffle? is this problematic and what if a listing creator becomes the listing winner (same address or different one)
