## Low Risk

### [L-01] The DKIM logic to verify headers allows weird cases

The `_verifyHeaders` method in `DKIMRecoverySigValidator` now allows for the following two anomalies:

1. A valid set of headers that have extra text in between them, which is in between two `\r\n` expressions
2. Reordered `subject`, `to` and `from` headers are now allowed - previously the order - `from`, `to`, `subject` was expected

You can change the code to be a sequential state machine, basically enforcing an order of text in headers.

### [L-02] No `withdrawTo` functionality in `AmbirePaymaster`

The ERC4337 implementation on Ethereum has a `StakeMaster` contract with a `withdrawTo` functionality, allowing a paymaster to withdraw his deposit as seen [here](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/674b1f51164e641a18d5c141895bab9c96a68e9d/contracts/core/StakeManager.sol#L137-L148). The issue is that `AmbirePaymaster` doesn't implement a direct way to call this functionality but it does, however, have the arbitrary call functionality allowed for the `relayer` address. Through that functionality the `withdrawTo` method can be called, but the `call` method has the following comment in its NatSpec:

```solidity
* @notice  This method can be used to withdraw stuck tokens or airdrops
```

which means it wasn't expected to do so. If you plan on using `call` for other things as well, consider making it `payable` since it uses a `value` argument but the contract doesn't have a way to receive ETH.
