# Findings

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Minting and burning of `BeamToken` is centralized

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as token supply can be endlessly inflated and user tokens can be burned on demand

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malicious or compromised admin/minter/burner

**Description**

Currently the `mint` and `burn` methods in `BeamToken` are controlled by `MINTER_ROLE` and `BURNER_ROLE` respectively. Those roles are controlled by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` which is given to the `BeamToken` deployer. This means that if the admin or minter or burner account is malicious or compromised it can decide to endlessly inflate the token supply or to burn any user's token balance, which would lead to a loss of funds for users.

**Recommendations**

Give those roles only to contracts that have a Timelock mechanism so that users have enough time to exit their `BeamToken` positions if they decide that they don't agree with a transaction of the admin/minter/burner.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Using a vulnerable version of an external library

In `package.json` we can see that the OpenZeppelin library version used is `"@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.3.1"`. According to OpenZeppelin's [Security Advisories](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories) you can see that this version contains multiple High and Moderate severity vulnerabilities. While the code in-scope is not using the vulnerable parts of the library code at the moment, it is highly recommended to update to the latest stable version that has no breaking changes, meaning version 4.9.3.

### [L-02] Using an older Solidity compiler version

Currently the protocol contracts use `pragma solidity 0.8.6;` which is a version that according to the [List of Known Bugs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/bugs.html) in Solidity contains some Low severity issues. It is highly suggested to update the compiler version to a more recent one to make use of bugfixes and optimizations.
