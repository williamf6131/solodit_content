# Findings

## High Risk

### [H-01] Anyone can use or steal `ArbitrumSwaps` native asset balance

**Likelihood:**
High, because this can easily be noticed and exploited

**Impact:**
Medium, because value can be stolen, but it should be limited to gas refunds

**Description**

An attacker can steal the `ArbitrumSwaps` native asset balance by doing a call to the `arbitrumSwaps` method with steps `WETH_DEPOSIT` and `WETH_WITHDRAW` - this will send over the whole contract balance to a caller-supplied address. This shouldn't be a problem, because the contract is a "swap router" and is not expected to hold any native asset balance at any time. Well this assumption does not hold, because in the `stargateSwap` method the `_refundAddress` argument of the `swap` method call to the `stargateRouter` is `address(this)`. This means that all of the native asset that is refunded will be held by the `ArbitrumSwaps` contract and an attacker can back-run this refund and steal the balance.

**Recommendations**

The refund address should be `msg.sender` and not `address(this)`. This way the protocol won't be expected to receive native assets, so they can be stolen only if someone mistakenly sends them to the `ArbitrumSwaps` contract which is an expected risk.

### [H-02] Malicious user can easily make the protocol revert on every `USDT` swap on Uniswap

**Likelihood:**
High, attack can easily be done and it exploits a well-known attack vector of `USDT`

**Impact:**
Medium, because the protocol will not work with only one ERC20 token, but it is a widely used one

**Description**

A malicious user can get the `ArbitrumSwaps` contract to revert on each `USDT` swap on Uniswap, because of a well-known attack vector of the token implementation. The problem is in the following code from `UniswapAdapter.sol` and is present in both `swapExactInputSingle` and `swapExactInputMultihop`

```solidity
        TransferHelper.safeApprove(
            swapParams.token1, address(swapRouter), IERC20(swapParams.token1).balanceOf(address(this))
        );
```

Here is how the attack can be done:

1. Malicious user transfers manually 1 wei of USDT to `ArbitrumSwaps`
2. Now he calls `ArbitrumSwaps::arbitrumSwaps` with `step == UNI_SINGLE` to swap 1 USDT
3. Now `swapExactInputSingle` approves 1 + 1e-18 USDT, because of the `balanceOf` call
4. Transaction will complete successfully, but next time anyone wants to swap USDT on Uniswap the transaction will revert, because of USDT approval race condition - to do an `approve` call the allowance should be either 0 or `type(uint256).max`, which is not the case because allowance is 1 wei

**Recommendation**

Instead of using the `IERC20(multiParams.token1).balanceOf(address(this))` as the approved allowance, use the `amountIn` parameter.

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Use `quoteLayerZeroFee` instead of sending all native asset balance as gas fee for `swap` call

**Likelihood:**
High, because the wrong value will be sent always

**Impact:**
Low, because the `swap` function has a gas refund mechanism

**Description**

Currently in `StargateArbitrum::stargateSwap` when doing a call to the `swap` method of `stargateRouter`, all of the contract's native asset balance is sent to it so it can be used to pay the gas fee. The [Stargate docs](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/developers/cross-chain-swap-fee) show that there is a proper way to calculate the fee and it is by utilizing the `quoteLayerZeroFee` method of `stargateRouter`.

**Recommendations**

Follow the documentation to calculate the fee correctly instead of always sending the whole contract's balance as a fee, even though there is a refund mechanism.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Check array arguments have the same length

In both `ArbitrumSwaps::arbitrumSwaps` and in `StargateArbitrum::stargateSwap` you have multiple array-type arguments. Validate in both places that the arguments have the same length so you do not get unexpected errors if they don't.

### [L-02] A `require` check can easily be bypassed

In `StargateArbitrum::stargateSwap` we have the following code

```solidity
if (msg.value <= 0) revert MustBeGt0();
```

This check can easily be bypassed by just sending 1 wei. Remove the check completely, since `msg.value` is not used in the method anyway.

### [L-03] The `gasLeft()` after gas-limited external call might not be enough to complete the transaction

In `StargateArbitrum::sgReceive` we have the following piece of code

```solidity
try IArbitrumSwaps(payable(address(this))).arbitrumSwaps{gas: 200000}(steps, data) {}
        catch (bytes memory) {
            IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(to, amountLD);
            failed = true;
        }
```

Now if the `arbitrumSwaps` call took up all of the gas it is possible that there is not enough gas left for the `safeTransfer` call, as well for the code below it. Consider a different approach, that will check `gasleft()` and make sure that there will be enough, something like in [this method](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/9a85946574135d57194c44bf27376732091974cc/protocols/sushixswap/contracts/adapters/StargateAdapter.sol#L114-L171)

## Informational

### [I-01] Prefer battle-tested code over reimplementing common patterns

Replace the `locked` modifier in `ArbitrumSwaps` with the `nonReentrant` from OpenZeppelin, since it is well tested and optimized.

### [I-02] Use an enum for the "step" types in `ArbitrumSwaps`

Currently the step types are handled by constants that have an integer value and are not sequential (numbers 7 to 11 are missing). This is a great use case for an enum, where you will have sequential numbering and proper naming. Remove the constants and use an enum.

### [I-03] Move code to bring cohesion up

The event `FeePaid` and the `calculateFee` method should both be in `ArbitrumSwaps` instead of in `StargateArbitrum` since they have nothing to do with the Stargate logic, but are used in some swap/transfer scenarios.

### [I-04] Use `x != 0` to get positive-only uint values

The "positive uint" checks in the code are not done in the best possible way, one example is `_amount <= 0` - if a number is expected to be of a `uint` type, then you can check that it is positive by doing `x != 0` since `uint` can never be a negative number. Replace all `x <= 0` occurrences with `x != 0` when `x` is a `uint`.

### [I-05] Remove not needed custom error

The `MoreThanZero` custom error in `ArbitrumSwaps` is badly named and also duplicates the inherited from `StargateArbitrum` custom error `MustBeGt0` - prefer using the latter and remove the former.

### [I-06] Solidity safe pragma best practices are not used

Always use a stable pragma to be certain that you deterministically compile the Solidity code to the same bytecode every time. Also `IStargateReceiver` and `IStargateRouter` interfaces are using an old compiler version - upgrade it to a newer version, use the same pragma statement throughout the whole codebase.

### [I-07] External method missing a NatSpec

The `arbitrumSwaps` method in `ArbitrumSwaps` is missing a NatSpec doc, add one to improve the code technical documentation.

### [I-08] Mismatch between contract and file names

The `ArbitrumSwaps` contract inherits from `SushiLegacyAdapter` which is imported from `SushiAdapter.sol`. Use the same name for the smart contract and the file.

### [I-09] Missing `override` keyword

The method `arbitrumSwaps` in `ArbitrumSwaps` is inheriting the method from `IArbitrumSwaps` but is missing the `override` keyword which should be there.

### [I-10] Typos in comments

In `StargateArbitrum` you wrote `arrat` -> `array`
