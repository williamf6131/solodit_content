### [L-01] Malicious actor can evade the `FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE` role

The protocol has implemented the `FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE` role so that the `StakedUSDe` owner has authority over blacklisting addresses and then manipulating their balances. This mechanism is flawed and an attacker can bypass it - let's look at an example:

1. A user does a malicious action or is understood to be a bad actor. The `StakedUSDe` owner decides to blacklist his address
2. The `StakedUSDe` owner sends a transaction with a call to `addToBlacklist` for the address of the malicious user
3. The user is monitoring Ethereum's mempool and front-runs this transaction, sending all of his `stUSDe` balance to another address he controls
4. Now his old address is blacklisted as he has the `FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE` role, but all of his tokens are in his new address and can be used as normal

The current best solution is enforcing the usage of a private mempool service for all admin actions.

**Discussion**

**Ethena:** Fixed. Transactions will be always submitted only through Flashbots.

### [L-02] Unchecked method return values can lead to errors

In the `StakedUSDe` contract we have the `addToBlacklist` and `removeFromBlacklist` methods that call `_grantRole` and `_revokeRole` respectively. The return values of the latter should be checked in both cases, so that when granting a role it is certain that the `target` didn't already have this role, and when revoking a role it is certain that the `target` did actually have this role.

**Discussion**

**Ethena:** Acknowledged. Won't fix since it would add gas cost overhead.

### [L-03] The `SOFT_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE` gives a false sense of security

The role forbids its holders to deposit tokens into `StakedUSDe` or receive minted shares from it. This protection can be bypassed by an account transferring his tokens to another address that doesn't have the role, but the initial account controls it, and can deposit tokens or mint share from `StakedUSDe` successfully. Consider removing the role and sticking to using `FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE` only.

**Discussion**

**Ethena:** Acknowledged. This is a part of the design. Ethena is legally required to not pay yield to users from certain countries, and we will show best effort, including having on chain restrictions. This covers us legally, but sophisticated users will be able to bypass this restriction in a variety of ways, such as buying/selling stUSDe on open market or transferring funds to different addresses to stake/unstake.

### [L-04] EIP712 is not correctly implemented for the `Route` struct

As stated in the [EIP712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-encodedata) standard - "The array values are encoded as the keccak256 hash of the concatenated encodeData of their contents". This is not correctly followed in `EthenaMinting::encodeRoute` as it does not do this for the `Route` struct array fields. While this is usually a more serious problem, the method is not called in the protocol and can just be removed.

**Discussion**

**Ethena:** Fixed. The `encodeRoute` method has been removed.
