# Findings

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] `claimTimeout` is not checked for first claim by an account

**Likelihood:**
High, because it will happen for each account's first claim

**Impact:**
Low, because there is no loss of funds, but code is not working as intended

**Description**

In `claimRewards` in `LP.sol` there is the following check

```solidity
if ((block.timestamp - reward.claimedAt) < claimTimeout)
    revert ClaimTimeout(reward.claimedAt + claimTimeout);
```

which basically forces an account that claims his rewards to wait for at least `claimTimeout` amount of time. The problem is, in `addReserve` the reward amount is set, but `reward.claimedAt` is not set to `block.timestamp`. This means that `reward.claimedAt` will be 0 the first time `claimRewards` is called for an address, so the `claimTimeout` check will pass even though the time might have not passed yet.

**Recommendations**

When setting the reward amount in `addReserve` also set `reward.claimedAt = block.timestamp`

### [M-02] Protocol can't use smaller decimals tokens as bet tokens

**Likelihood:**
Medium, because such tokens are widely used and accepted

**Impact:**
Medium, because it limits the functionality of the protocol

**Description**

The current implementation of the protocol allows it to only use higher (for example 18) decimals tokens like `DAI` for betting and liquidity provision. This is enforced by the `minDepo` property in `LP.sol` which can't be less than 1e12 for adding liquidity, as well as the check for `amount` in `putBet` in `Core.sol` where `amount` should be >1e12. If a smaller decimals tokens is to be used (for example `USDT`, `USDC`, `wBTC`) then the users and LPs will need to have a very high amount of capital to interact with the platform.

**Recommendations**

Revisit the validations for `minDepo` and `amount`, one possible approach is to calculate those based on the token's decimals

### [M-03] Missing admin input sanitization

**Likelihood:**
Low, because it requires a malicious/compromised admin or an error on admin side

**Impact:**
High, because important protocol functionality can be bricked

**Description**

It is not checked that the `claimTimeout` property in `LP.sol` both in its setter function and in `initialize` does not have a very big value. Same thing for the setter function of `withdrawTimeout`. Also, the `checkFee` method in `LP.sol` has a loose validation - the max sum of all fees should be much lower than 100%. Finally the `startsAt` argument of `shiftGame` in `LP.sol` is not validated that it is not after the current timestamp.

**Recommendations**

Add an upper cap for `claimTimeout` & `withdrawTimeout`. Make the max sum of all fees to be lower - for example 20%. In `shiftGame` check that `startsAt >= blockTimestamp`.

### [M-04] `OwnableUpgradeable` uses single-step ownership transfer

**Likelihood:**
Low, because it requires an error on the admin side

**Impact:**
High, because important protocol functionality will be bricked

**Description**

Single-step ownership transfer means that if a wrong address was passed when transferring ownership or admin rights it can mean that role is lost forever. The ownership pattern implementation for the protocol is in `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` where a single-step transfer is implemented.This can be a problem for all methods marked in `onlyOwner` throughout the protocol, some of which are core protocol functionality.

**Recommendations**

It is a best practice to use two-step ownership transfer pattern, meaning ownership transfer gets to a "pending" state and the new owner should claim his new rights, otherwise the old owner still has control of the contract. Consider using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable2Step` contract

### [M-05] Admin privileges are dangerous

**Likelihood:**
Low, because it requires a malicious/compromised admin

**Impact:**
High, because a rug pull can be executed

**Description**

A malicious or a compromised admin can execute a 100% rug pull in the following way:

1. The `LP` admin calls the `Factory` contract to add a malicious `core` to the `LP`
2. The malicious `core` returns the `LP` contract balance when its `resolveAffiliateReward` method is called
3. Now calling `claimAffiliateReward` with the fake `core` as an argument will result in a 100% of the `LP` balance stolen

Same thing applies to `withdrawPayout`.

**Recommendations**

Make the process of adding a new `coreType` or calling `plugCore` to be safer. One possible approach is by adding a time delay before a core is added to the `LP`, up until which the request will be pending.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Prefer using `_safeMint` over `_mint`

Both `Access::grantRole` and `LP::_addLiquidity` use ERC721's `_mint` method, which is missing the check if the account to mint the NFT to is a smart contract that can handle ERC721 tokens. The `_safeMint` method does exactly this, so prefer using it over `_mint` but always add a `nonReentrant` modifier, since calls to `_safeMint` can reenter.

### [L-02] Missing event emission

The `changeLockedLiquidity` method in `LP.sol` does not emit an event which might not be good for off-chain monitoring. Emit a proper event in both paths, adding liquidity and reducing it. Same problem exists in `AzuroBet::setURI` - emit an event on state change.

### [L-03] Protocol won't work with tokens with a fee-on-transfer or a rebasing mechanism

Some tokens on the blockchain make arbitrary changes to account balances. Examples are fee-on-transfer tokens and tokens with rebasing mechanisms. There is no specific handling for such tokens, as the amount held by the `LP` contract might actually be less than it has accounted for. Think about handling such tokens or document the list of ERC20 tokens you intend to support in the protocol.

### [L-04] The `coreAffRewards` mapping is not checked in `claimAffiliateReward`

When calling `claimAffiliateReward` for a core in `LP.sol` the `coreAffRewards` mapping is not checked to see if the core has actually earned enough rewards for the claim. Add a validation for the mapping.

### [L-05] Call to `azuroBet.mint()` can reenter

The `mint` function in `azuroBet` does an external call to check if the recipient is a smart contract that can handle such tokens. This call is unsafe, as the recipient can be malicious and do a reentrancy call. Consider adding a `nonReentrant` modifier to methods in `Core.sol`

### [L-06] Code is lacking technical documentation

In multiple places throughout the code there is a need for technical documentation as dev assumptions are not clear and some math formulas are used but it is not clear why. One example for this is `CoreBase::_applyOdds` - consider adding technical documentation to complex code for easier understandability by users & auditors. Also revisit existing NatSpec docs and add information for all parameters, as that is missing in multiple places.

### [L-07] Unused method is not working as intended

The method `getLeavesAmount` in `LiquidityTree` will return just the `node` amount and won't consider the amounts in its leaves. Method is not used anywhere, consider removing it.

## Informational

### [I-01] Use braces around operators with uncertain precedence

In `Access::roleGranted` we see the following code

```solidity
return userRoles[account] & roleBit == roleBit;
```

In Solidity the `&` operator will be executed before `==` but this might not always be clear and might be different in other languages. I suggest adding braces around `userRoles[account] & roleBit` to clarify operator precedence.

### [I-02] The `stopCondition` method can start a condition as well as stopping

The `stopCondition` method and its event show intention that they only have functionality for stopping a condition, but they can start it again. Use different wording, for example `updateConditionStatus`.

### [I-03] Move not essential logic to off-chain computations

The `game.conditions` array is written to in `LP::addCondition` but is never read in the system. Consider moving this logic to the front end services.

### [I-04] Redundant code

The `assert(affiliateProfits[i] >= oldProfit - newProfit);` check is redundant, since the next line of code `affiliateProfits[i] -= (oldProfit - newProfit).toUint128();` will fail if condition checked is false. Consider removing redundant code.

### [I-05] Open `TODO` in code

The `_resolveCondition` method in `CoreBase.sol` has an open `TODO`, consider fixing or deleting it.

### [I-06] Unused imports

All imports in `IBet.sol` are unused, consider removing those. Same for `OwnableUpgradeable` import in `Core`

### [I-07] Method inherited from interface is missing the `override` keyword

The `changeOdds` method in `CoreBase` is missing the `override` keyword, consider adding it.

### [I-08] Use a safe pragma statement

Always use stable pragma statement to lock the compiler version. Also there are different versions of the compiler used throughout the codebase, use only one. Finally consider upgrading the version to a newer one to use bugfixes and optimizations in the compiler.

### [I-09] Small issues in initializer methods

In `AzuroBet::initialize` the call to `__ERC165_init` is missing and should be added. Also `__Ownable_init_unchained` is called in `Access::initialize` which does not initialize call the `Context` initializer, call `__Ownable_init` instead.

### [I-10] Typos in NatSpec

In `IWNative`, the NatSpec has two typos - `interrface` -> `interface` and `vbased` -> `based`. Also move the NatSpec to be just above the interface declaration, not before the `pragma` statement.

### [I-11] Wrong import

Change the `ICore` import in `Factory` to `ICoreBase` since that is the one that is used.

### [I-12] Consider using custom errors instead of require statements with string error

Custom errors reduce the contract size and can provide easier integration with a protocol. Consider using those instead of require statements with string error
