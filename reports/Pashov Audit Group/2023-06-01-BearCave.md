# Findings

## High Risk

### [C-01] State is not properly updated on L2, leading to stuck prize NFTs

**Impact:**
High, as winning prize NFTs won't be claimable

**Likelihood:**
High, as functionality is never working correctly

**Description**

The `addToParty` method in `HibernationDen` does not send a cross-chain message, even though it pushes sleepers into the `party.sleepoors` array on L1. Since the array won't be updated on L2, now all the calculations and validations that are done based on the `party.sleepoors.length` value will be incorrect. This essentially means that the sleeper NFTs will be stuck as in `wakeSleeper` there is the following check:

```solidity
if (party.numUsed == party.sleepoors.length) revert PartyAlreadyWoke(bundleId_);
```

Which means that even though there are actually let's say 10 sleepers (they were 7, but then 3 were added), when `numUsed` is 7 then no more sleepers would be claimable - the `wakeSleeper` call will revert will `PartyAlreadyWoke`.

**Recommendations**

Make sure to send a cross-chain message to add the sleepers to the `party.sleeepoors` array on the L2.

### [C-02] Anyone can burn any NFT in the `HoneyJarPortal`

**Impact:**
High, because the NFTs won't be retrievable from the portal anymore

**Likelihood:**
High, because it does not require any preconditions to be exploited

**Description**

The `_debitFrom` method in `HoneyJarPortal` allows burning of any `HoneyJar` NFT, given its ID. This method is freely callable through `ONFT721Core`'s `sendFrom` method, which calls `_send` which calls the `_debitFrom` method without an access control check. This results in the ability for anyone to burn any HoneyJar NFT, no matter who holds it. There is the following check in the method:

```solidity
if (_from != _msgSender()) revert OwnerNotCaller();
```

which shows an access control intention, but is actually redundant as the `_from` argument is not used in the burning process.

**Recommendations**

The code should check that the caller actually owns the NFT that is about to get burned - the current check does not do this. Update it accordingly.

## High Risk

### [H-01] Accepting input after randomness is requested can be exploited

**Impact:**
High, as it can result in a griefing attack on an expected game winner

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it requires minting a new HoneyJar NFT

**Description**

The [VRF security considerations docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#dont-accept-bidsbetsinputs-after-you-have-made-a-randomness-request) explicitly mention that if an outcome in the contract depends on user-supplied inputs (in this case minting HoneyJar NFTs) and randomness, then the contract should stop accepting any additional user-supplied inputs after it submits the randomness request. The problem here is that in `fulfillRandomWords` the `_setFermentedJars` method is called where the number of HoneyJar NFTs minted for a bundle is used for the process of choosing the winning NFT - this means that the `fulfillRandomWords` transaction can be front-ran with a HoneyJar NFT mint and the winner will be different. This can result in a griefing attack for an expected winner of a game.

**Recommendations**

Decouple the randomness request and the user input from each other. Use only the user input that has been submitted pre-requesting randomness.

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] The `fulfillRandomWords` method might revert with out of gas error

**Impact:**
High, as randomness won't be fulfilled

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires misconfiguration of gas

**Description**

The `fulfillRandomWords` method in `HibernationDen` calls the internal `_setFermentedJars` method which loops over the `fermentedJars` array and also has an external call. This is a potential problem as this code might require a lot of gas and make the `fulfillRandomWords` method revert which is problematic for a VRF integration (it is listed in the [VRF Security Considerations docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#fulfillrandomwords-must-not-revert)).

Another such issue in the method is this code:

```solidity
if (party.assetChainId != getChainId() && address(honeyJarPortal) != address(0) && address(this).balance != 0) {
    uint256 sendAmount = address(this).balance / party.checkpoints.length;
    honeyJarPortal.sendFermentedJars{value: sendAmount}(
        address(this), party.assetChainId, party.bundleId, fermentedJars
    );
}
```

The problem is that when `party.assetChainId != getChainId() && address(honeyJarPortal) != address(0)` are true, then the only thing left to go into the `if` statement is `address(this).balance != 0` - this is easily exploitable as anyone can send 1 wei of ETH into the contract, which will make the expression evaluate to `true`. This will add additional gas cost overhead as it will execute an external call that has more logic, and also the cross-chain call is almost certainly failing as the `sendAmount` is possible to have rounded down to zero (if `address(this).balance` was 1 but `party.checkpoints.length` was more than 1).

**Recommendations**

Consider caching the randomness received and then letting an externally owed account for example to actually make the `_setFermentedJars` call so it can set the correct gas. Also check that the balance is enough to do the `sendFermentedJars` call, not just that the balance is non-zero.

### [M-02] Contract `HibernationDen` can receive ETH but it can't be withdrawn

**Impact:**
Medium, as it will result in stuck funds, but they will just have the value of gas refunded

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it will happen when there is a refund from a cross-chain call

**Description**

The `HibernationDen` contract has a `receive` method. This is mostly expected to be used for `LayerZero` refunds as the comment above the method says. The problem is that this gas refunds ETH won't be withdrawable as there is no method for ETH withdraw in the contract. Another issue is that anyone can mistakenly send ETH to `HibernationDen` and it will be stuck there.

**Recommendations**

Add a method that can withdraw ETH from the `HibernationDen` contract.

### [M-03] Centralization attack vectors are present in the code

**Impact:**
High, as some accounts can brick the game

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malicious or compromised owner/admin account

**Description**

There are multiple centralization attack vectors present in the contracts. Examples are:

- `HibernationDen::setVRFConfig` - updating this with arbitrary values can break the game
- `HoneyJarPortal::setHibernationDen` - updating it to a random address will DoS the game
- `HoneyJarPortal::setAdapterParams` - using too low of a `gasLimit` value will result in out of gas reverts

**Recommendations**

Make the methods callable only once or add them to the constructors/initializer methods.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Not enforced checkpoints gap size

For the `checkpoints` field in the `SlumberParty` struct we have the following comment:

> /// @dev the gap between checkpoints MUST be big enough so that a user can't mint through multiple checkpoints.

This is just an assumption, as the place where the `checkpoints` value is set (`HibernationDen::addBundle`) does not actually enforce this. This couldn't actually lead to a serious problem but it is best that the comment is removed and actual checks & validations are implemented in the code, so the gap between the set checkpoints can't be too small.
