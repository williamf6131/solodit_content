# Findings

## High Risk

### [C-01] Scaling of `underlyingTokenPrice` will leave funds stuck in protocol

**Impact:**
High, as all deposited funds will be stuck in the protocol

**Likelihood:**
High, as it will always happen

**Description**

The `_getTokenPrices` method in `SwapFacility` has the following code:

```solidity
underlyingTokenPrice =
    uint256(IOracle(underlyingTokenOracle).latestAnswer()) *
    1e12;
```

This scaling by `1e12` is an error, because most oracle price feeds in Chainlink (and more specifically, the one that is expected to be used, `USDC/USD`) return an 8 decimals number. Since this `underlyingTokenPrice` value will be divided by the `billyTokenPrice` value which again is in 8 decimals, this will result in a calculation error and overinflation of the `outAmount` in the `_swap` method. Since the `SwapFacility` contract won't be holding so many tokens in its balance, the calls to `swap` will always revert, leaving the `BloomPool` contract in a stuck state - with all deposited funds in it but without an ability to continue further through its phases.

**Recommendations**

Do not scale the price by `1e12`. Clearly define the price feeds that will be used and if they have different decimals only then scale them to the expected decimals count.

## High Risk

### [H-01] The protocol does not implement slippage checks on swaps

**Impact:**
High, as it can result in a substantial loss of value if there is big price movement

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as slippage is never handled, but it requires specific market conditions

**Description**

The protocol mentions in its `README` file that the `SwapFacility` has to implement slippage checks, but it doesn't. If a swap transaction is sent to the mempool, but it takes a while until it is executed, it is possible that there was big price movement and the swap returned value is substantially lower than what it was initially expected to be, which will be a value loss for the protocol & its users.

**Recommendations**

Add a `minOutAmount` parameter to `SwapFacility::_swap` and check that the swap resulted in at least that many tokens, otherwise revert.

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] The swap mechanism does not have a deadline parameter

**Impact:**
High, as the swap might forcefully result in a big slippage (or maximum allowed one)

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires special conditions

**Description**

Swap mechanisms should implement a transaction deadline mechanism, due to the following attack vector:

1. Alice wants to execute a swap, sets slippage to 10% and sends a transaction to the mempool, but with a very low gas fee
2. Miners/validators see the transaction but the fe is not attractive, so the transaction is stale and pending for a long time
3. After a week (let's say) the average gas fees drop low enough for the miners/validators to execute the transaction but the price of the assets has changed drastically
4. Now the value Alice receives is much lower and possibly close to the max slippage she set.

The effects are even worse when there is no slippage as it is the current case in the protocol.

**Recommendations**

Add a `deadline` timestamp parameter to the `SwapFacility::_swap` method and revert the transaction if the expiry has passed.

### [M-02] Missing price feed validation and usage of a deprecated method can lead to 0 price

**Impact:**
High, as using a 0 price would mess the swap calculations

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malfunctioning price feed

**Description**

The `_getTokenPrices` method in `SwapFacility` makes use of the `latestAnswer` method from Chainlink price feeds. The problem is that the NatSpec of `latestAnswer` says this:

> @dev #[deprecated] Use latestRoundData instead. This does not error if no
> answer has been reached, it will simply return 0. Either wait to point to
> an already answered Aggregator or use the recommended latestRoundData
> instead which includes better verification information.```

So currently it is possible that `latestAnswer` returns 0 and the code operates with zero price, leading to miscalculations in the rate of `underlyingToken` to `billyToken` which will lead to a loss of funds.

**Recommendations**

As pointed out in the comment, use `latestRoundData` instead to query a price feed.

### [M-03] Centralization attack vectors are present

**Impact:**
High, as it can break the protocol for users

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malicious or a compromised owner

**Description**

The `owner` of `SwapFacility` can change the `pool` variable any time, meaning it can be set to `address(0)` for example, breaking the protocol's `swap` functionality. Another such issue is that the `setSpreadPrice` method does not do any input validation, meaning the `spreadPrice` can be set to a huge number that is bigger than the token prices, which will make the spread subtraction revert the `swap` transactions every time.

**Recommendations**

Make `setPool` callable only once and also put an upper bound of the `spreadPrice` value.

### [M-04] Tokens with a fee-on-transfer mechanism will break the protocol

**Impact:**
High, as some users will lose value

**Likelihood:**
Low, as such tokens are not common

**Description**

The ERC20 logic in `BloomPool` is incompatible with tokens that have a fee-on-transfer mechanism. Such tokens for example is `PAXG`, while `USDT` has a built-in fee-on-transfer mechanism that is currently switched off. One example of this `BloomPool::depositBorrower` where the following code:

```solidity
UNDERLYING_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

This will work incorrectly if the token has a fee-on-transfer mechanism - the contract will cache `amount` as its expected added balance, but it will actually add `amount - fee` balance. This will result in a revert in the last person to withdraw tokens out of the contract. Same thing applies for other `transferFrom` calls that transfer tokens into the protocol, for example in `SwapFacility::_swap`.

**Recommendations**

You should cache the balance before a `transferFrom` to the contract and then check it after the transfer and use the difference between them as the newly added balance. This also requires a `nonReentrant` modifier, as otherwise ERC777 tokens can manipulate this. Another fix is to just document and announce you do not support tokens that can have a fee-on-transfer mechanism.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Usage of `safeApprove` might be incompatible with tokens like `USDT`

Some tokens implement an approval race protection mechanism (`USDT`, `KNC`) which requires the pre-approval allowance to be either zero or `type(uint256).max`. Currently the code in `initiatePreHoldSwap` uses `safeApprove` for the `UNDERLYING_TOKEN`. If the previous allowance was not used until it was 0, then if `USDT` is the `UNDERLYING_TOKEN` the code will revert on the `safeApprove` call. It is recommended to use `forceApprove` from OpenZeppelin 4.9.1's `SafeERC20` so this case is covered properly.
