## High Risk

### [H-01] Sale creator can possibly steal bidders' claimable tokens

**Impact:**
High, as it results in a loss of funds for bidders

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it requires to claim before cliff expires

**Description**

In `StakedVestedCrowdSale` the sale creator can give the address to his own `TokenVesting` & `TimelockedToken` contracts. Same in `VestedCrowdSale` but only for `TimelockedToken`. Now if the sale creator is malicious he can give the addresses of his own deployed contracts that inherit from either `TokenVesting` or `TimelockedToken` but add functionality to pull the funds out on demand, while they are still locked in them. This is even worse when it comes to the token locking logic in `VestedCrowdSale`, where on sale settlement the `TimelockedToken` contract is approved to spend all the `auctionToken` that should be claimed, meaning if it has the functionality it can just pull the funds and transfer them out of the contract on demand. This will result in inability for bidders to claim their tokens and 100% loss of their value.

**Recommendations**

Enforce both `TokenVesting` & `TimelockedToken` contracts to be only internally deployed from a predefined bytecode/implementation and do not accept user-supplied contracts.

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Auction tokens with approval race protection or not returning a `bool` on `approve` are incompatible with `VestedCrowdSale`

**Impact:**
High, as sale won't be possible to be settled

**Likelihood:**
Low, as such tokens are rare, but they do exist

**Description**

Some tokens, for example [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7) (not a good example because auction tokens have to have 18 decimals) and [KNC](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200#code) (18 decimals) have approval race protection mechanism and require the allowance to be either 0 or `uint256.max` when it is updated. The problem is that in `VestedCrowdSale` the following code is present:

```solidity
uint256 currentAllowance = sale.auctionToken.allowance(address(this), address(salesVesting[saleId].vestingContract));

//the poor man's `increaseAllowance`
sale.auctionToken.approve(address(salesVesting[saleId].vestingContract), currentAllowance + sale.salesAmount);
```

This will not work with tokens that have such a mechanism and will revert when `currentAllowance` is non-zero.

Another issue is that there are tokens that do not follow the ERC20 standard (like `USDT` again) that do not return a `bool` on `approve` call. Those tokens are incompatible with the protocol because Solidity will check the return data size, which will be zero and will lead to a revert.

**Recommendations**

Do the approvals only in `VestedCrowdSale::_claimAuctionTokens` just before tokens are about to be locked, or just approve to zero first. Make sure to use `forceApprove` from `SafeERC20`.

### [M-02] Insufficient input validation in `CrowdSale` configuration

**Impact:**
High, as it can lock up valuable tokens almost permanently

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a fat-finger or a big configuration error

**Description**

There are two flaws in the configuration validation of a new `CrowdSale`. It is currently possible to create a never ending `Sale` as the `closingTime` field does not have a max value check. It is also possible that a never ending lock or a 0 duration lock is used in `VestedCrowdSale` as the `cliff` argument of `startSale` is not validated as in `StakedVestedCrowdSale::startSale`. Both can result in almost permanently locked tokens which is a value loss for users.

**Recommendations**

Add proper min & max value bounds for both `closingTime` and `cliff` parameters.

### [M-03] Tokens with a fee-on-transfer mechanism will break the protocol

**Impact:**
High, as some users will lose value

**Likelihood:**
Low, as such tokens are not common

**Description**

The ERC20 logic in all crowd sale contracts as well as in `TimelockedToken` is incompatible with tokens that have a fee-on-transfer mechanism. Such tokens for example is `PAXG`, while `USDT` has a built-in fee-on-transfer mechanism that is currently switched off. One example of this `CrowdSale::startSale` where the following code:

```solidity
sale.auctionToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sale.salesAmount);
```

Will work incorrectly if the token has a fee-on-transfer mechanism - the contract will cache `sale.salesAmount` as it's expected balance, but it will actually have `sale.salesAmount - fee` balance. This will result in a revert in the last person to transfer `auctionTokens` out of the contract. Same thing applies for other `transferFrom` calls that transfer tokens into the protocol, for example in `TimelockedToken::lock`.

**Recommendations**

You should cache the balance before a `transferFrom` to the contract and then check it after the transfer and use the difference between them as the newly added balance. This also requires a `nonReentrant` modifier, as otherwise ERC777 tokens can manipulate this. Another fix is to just document and announce you do not support tokens that can have a fee-on-transfer mechanism.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Round down instead of up for token claims

Currently all the `wad` math in `CrowdSale`s contracts is rounding up. This is not good for token claims as if some user claims 1 wei of token more than he should had it is possible that for the final user who claims to get to a revert. Make sure to round down instead of up for token claims.

### [L-02] Use pull over push pattern in `CrowdSale::settle`

The `settle` method in `CrowdSale` is directly transferring funds to the `sale.beneficiary`, in `SaleState.FAILED` case `auctionToken`s and in `SaleState.SETTLED` `biddingToken`s. If either of those tokens has a blacklisting mechanism and the beneficiary has been blacklisted, this will result in all `auctionToken`s and `biddingToken`s in the sale being stuck in it, as there will be no way to `settle` the sale. You can use the pull over push pattern to resolve this issue, for example by not force-transferring the funds to the `sale.beneficiary`, but adding a method through which he should claim them.

### [L-03] Usage of `address payable`'s `send` method is discouraged

The `send` method of `address payable` is deprecated as if the callee has a `receive` or `fallback` function that takes up more than 2300 gas then the method will revert. Since there are many smart wallets or multi-sig wallets that take more than 2300 gas on native asset receival, it is recommended to use `call` with value instead

```diff
-require(payable(_msgSender()).send(address(this).balance), "transfer failed");
+msgSender().call{value: address(this).balance}("");
```

### [L-04] Percentage setter should be bounded

The `Fractionalizer::setReceiverPercentage` method sets a percentage value that is unbounded, meaning it can possibly be more than 100%. While this functionality is still not used it seems dangerous. I suggest you remove it until it is used (together with `setFeeReceiver`), or add a `MAX_VALUE` constant to cap the percentage value possible.

### [L-05] Correct state is not enforced in `CrowdSale::claim`

The `claim` method in `CrowdSale` will revert if a sale is still in `RUNNING` state and will go through the `claimFailed` route if it is in `FAILED` state. The problem is that it doesn't enforce a revert if the state after the first checks is not `SETTLED`. This currently is not problematic but can lead to subtle bugs in the future, like claiming for a sale that is neither `FAILED` or `SETTLED`.
