## Medium Risk

### [M-01] The `emergencyWithdraw` method can leave `PirexEth` in a broken state

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as the logic in `PirexEth` will be broken

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires an emergency and using the contract after it

**Description**

The `emergencyWithdraw` method in `PirexEth` allows for withdrawal of ETH. This ETH could have been the `pendingDeposit` balance, which is not yet deposited to the ETH 2.0 deposit contract, and if it is withdrawn from the `emergencyWithdraw` method then the contract will be in a broken state. The `pendingDeposit` variable will have a value that is more than the ETH balance in the contract which will make deposit transactions revert if they are used post `emergencyWithdraw` call.

**Recommendations**

Change the `emergencyWithdraw` method so that it can withdraw only excessive balance without the `pendingDeposit` one, or when using `pendingDeposit` force it to withdraw the whole balance and zero out the state variable.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Updating `withdrawalCredentials` is flawed

The `setContract` method in `PirexEthValidators` updates the `withdrawalCredentials` state variable when the `RewardRecipient` contract address is updated. If there already are validators in the `_initializedValidators` array, they would have been configured with different `withdrawalCredentials`. This is not an issue, as if a validator has deposited even 1 ETH, when depositing more the `withdrawalCredentials` argument is not used in the deposit contract, but ignored. Still, for extra safety and logical correctness, make sure to only allow updating `withdrawalCredentials` when there are no elements in the `_initializedValidators` array.

### [L-02] Penalty calculation in `previewRedeem` rounds in the wrong direction

The `previewRedeem` method in `AutoPxEth` calculates the penalty with the following code:

```solidity
uint256 penalty = (_totalSupply == 0 || _totalSupply - shares == 0)
    ? 0
    : assets.mulDivDown(withdrawalPenalty, FEE_DENOMINATOR);
```

The issue is that the math rounds down the penalty, but following the ERC4626 standard you should follow best security for the vault and when calculating the assets a user will receive when burning shares, the assets amount should be rounded down, where here since the penalty is rounded down, but penalty is subtracted from the `assets`, now the opposite effect happens. Make sure to use `mulDivUp` instead `mulDivDown` in the `penalty` calculation.

### [L-03] Upper bound setter checks missing

In `PirexEth` the `setMaxFee` method is missing an upper bound. Setting the max fee to be more than 100% allows setting the fee to be more than 100% as well, which shouldn't be possible. Add a max upper bound for the `setMaxFee` method, for example 50%.

Same issue with the `setMaxProcessedValidatorCount` method in `PirexEthValidators`, where putting a very high value can lead to a DoS of deposits. Add a max value for the `_count` argument, for example 20.

### [L-04] Setting allowances to 0 should be a valid operation

The `operatorApprove` method of `PxEth` currently reverts when the allowance amount is 0 which is a logical error - removing allowance (or setting it to 0) should be a valid operation. Remove the following line from `operatorApprove`:

```solidity
if (_amount == 0) revert Errors.ZeroAmount();
```
