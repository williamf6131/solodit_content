### [L-01] Renounce approvals from the previous mintContract

`StakingRewardsDistributor` gives approvals for a list of `_assets` to `mint_contract`. `setMintingContract()` can set the new `mint_contract`.
But previous asset approvals given to the previous `mintContract` are not revoked.

Consider implementing a function to renounce approvals from addresses.
