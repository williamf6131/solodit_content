### [H-01] Incorrect user accounting in `withdraw` method

**Proof of Concept**

The `withdraw` method in `NYProfitTakingVaultBaseV1` does incorrect user accounting in the following line:

```solidity
user.amount = user.amount - _shares;
```

In the `deposit` method we use the `user.amount` to store the amount of `underlying` tokens deposited, but in `withdraw` instead of subtracting the `underlying` tokens the code subtracts the shares burned.

**Impact**

Since `shares` are not 1:1 with `underlying` this will completely mess up the user accounting on each withdraw. It is possible to be in two directions - if `_shares` was less than the amount withdrawn, then the user will be able to withdraw more than he deposited, essentially a possibility to deplete the vault to zero. If `_shares` was more than the amount withdrawn, then the user will be able to withdraw less than he deposited, essentially a loss of value for users.

**Recommendation**

Make the following change:

```diff
- user.amount = user.amount - _shares;
+ user.amount = user.amount - r;
```

### [H-02] First vault depositor can steal subsequent depositors’ tokens

**Proof of Concept**

Imagine the following scenario:

1. A new vault has been deployed and configured, no depositors yet
2. Alice wants to deposit 10 ether(10e18) worth of `underlying` and sends a transaction to the public mempool
3. A MEV bot sees Alice’s transaction and front runs it by depositing 1 wei(1e-18) of `underlying`, resulting in him receiving 1 wei(1e-18) of vault tokens (shares)
4. The MEV bot also front runs Alice’s transaction with a transfer of 10 ether(10e18) of `underlying` to the vault via `ERC20::transfer`
5. Now the code calculates Alice’s shares as `shares = (_amount * totalSupply()) / _pool;` which is 10e18 \* 1 / (10e18 + 1) which is 0
6. Alice gets minted 0 shares, but she deposited 10e18 of `underlying`
7. Now the MEV bot backruns Alice’s transaction calling `withdraw` with his 1e-18 (1 wei) of share, which is the total supply, so he withdraws his deposit + Alice’s whole deposit

This can be replayed multiple times until the depositors notice the problem.

**Impact**

The result of this is 100% value loss for all subsequent depositors.

**Recommendation**

UniswapV2 fixed this with two types of protection:

[First](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L121), on the first `mint` it actually mints the first 1000 shares to the zero-address

[Second](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/ee547b17853e71ed4e0101ccfd52e70d5acded58/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L125), it requires that the minted shares are not 0

Implementing them both will resolve this vulnerability.

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] MEV can sandwich every harvest due to missing slippage tolerance value

**Proof of Concept**

In `NyPtvFantomWftmBooSpookyV2StrategyToUsdc` each time the `_harvestCore` method is called (on each harvest) it will call the `_swapFarmEmissionTokens` method which itself has the following code:

```solidity
IUniswapV2Router02(SPOOKY_ROUTER).swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
      booBalance,
      0,
      booToUsdcPath,
      address(this),
      block.timestamp
    );
```

The “0” here is the value of the `amountOutMin` argument which is used for slippage tolerance. 0 value here essentially means 100% slippage tolerance. This is a very easy target for MEV and bots to do a flash loan sandwich attack on each of the strategy’s swaps, resulting in very big slippage on each trade.

**Impact**

100% slippage tolerance can be exploited in a way that the strategy (so the vault and the users) receive much less value than it should had. This can be done on every trade if the trade transaction goes through a public mempool.

**Recommendation**

The best solution here is to make the `harvest` method of the vault be callable only by a list of trusted addresses which will send the transaction through a private mempool. This, combined with an on-chain calculation for an `amountOutMin` that is off from the expected `amountOut` by a slippage tolerance percentage (that might be configurable through a setter in the strategy) should be good enough to protect you from MEV sandwich attacks.

### [M-02] Hardcoded swap path might not be the most optimal/liquid one

**Proof of Concept**

Currently in `NyPtvFantomWftmBooSpookyV2StrategyToUsdc` the value of the `booToUsdcPath` trade path is not configurable and is basically hardcoded to be `[BOO, USDC]`. It is the same for the swap router, as it is currently hardcoded to point to the SpookySwap router. The problem is that the `BOO/USDC` pool on SpookySwap might not be the most optimal and liquid one, and maybe instead it would be better to go `BOO/USDT` and then `USDT/USDC`. If the `BOO/USDC` pair for example loses most of its liquidity (maybe LPs are not incentivised as much or they decided to move elsewhere) then the strategy will still be forced to do its swaps on `harvest` through the illiquid/non-optimal `BOO/USDC` pair on SpookySwap.

**Impact**

This can result in a loss of value for vault users, as if a more liquid pool was used for swaps it could have resulted in less slippage so a bigger reward.

**Recommendation**

Add setter functions for both the trade router and the trade path - make them configurable. One possible option is to hardcode the 3 most liquid Fantom exchanges and 3 possible trade paths and switch through them via the setter.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Missing `nonReentrant` modifier in functions with external calls

**Proof of Concept**

The `NYProfitTakingVaultBaseV1` contract inherits from OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard` contract and has marked most of its state-changing methods that do ERC20 external calls with the `nonReentrant` modifier. The problem is the modifier is missing on some of the functions that also do ERC20 external calls - the `depositOutputTokenForUsers` and `earn` methods. Currently the methods are not exploitable, but ERC777 tokens (which are ERC20 compatible) can reenter a method call because of their pre and post hooks, so the `nonReentrant` modifier is an important security measure when doing unsafe ERC20 external calls.

**Impact**

If ERC777 tokens were used as `rewardToken` or `underlying` they can reenter the `depositOutputTokenForUsers` and `earn` methods, which currently is not exploitable, but might become a big problem when new code is added.

**Recommendation**

Add the `nonReentrant` modifier to the `depositOutputTokenForUsers` and `earn` methods

### [L-02] If `underlying` or `rewardToken` is a two-address token then `inCaseTokensGetStuck` method can be used to rug users

**Proof of Concept**

Some ERC20 tokens on the blockchain are deployed behind a proxy, so they have at least 2 entrypoints (the proxy and the implementation) for their functionality. Example is Synthetix’s `ProxyERC20` contract from where you can interact with `sUSD, sBTC etc). If such a token was used as the `underlying`token in a vault, then the owner will be able to rug all depositors with the`inCaseTokensGetStuck` method, even though it has the following checks

```solidity
if (_token == address(underlying)) {
      revert NYProfitTakingVault__CannotWithdrawUnderlying();
}
if (_token == address(rewardToken)) {
      revert NYProfitTakingVault__CannotWithdrawRewardToken();
}
```

Since the tokens have multiple addresses the admin can give another address and pass those checks.

**Impact**

The potential impact is 100% loss of deposited tokens for users, but it requires a malicious/compromised owner and a special type of ERC20 token used in the vault.

**Recommendation**

Instead of checking the address of the withdrawn token, it is a better approach to check the balance of `underlying` and `rewardToken` before and after the transfer and to verify it is the same.

### [L-03] The `getPricePerFullShare` method returns a wrong value when `totalSupply` is 0

**Proof of Concept**

The `getPricePerFullShare` method currently computes the result by the following formula:

```solidity
return totalSupply() == 0 ? 1e18 : (balance() * 1e18) / totalSupply();
```

The problem is that when the underlying token used is with less or more than 18 decimals and the `totalSupply` is still 0, then the price returned won’t be correct, as it will be 1e18. The intention to return 1e18 when `totalSupply` is 0 looks like it comes from the amount of shares minted on the first deposit

```solidity
if (totalSupply() == 0) {
      shares = _amount;
}
```

so it looks like 1 share will equal 1 token, but if the token’s decimals are not 18 then 1 token is not 1e18 wei of this token.

**Impact**

Since this function is market with `public view` and is not used anywhere in the protocol, it will probably be used in front ends only, impacting the initial pricing of a vault share.

**Recommendation**

Make the following change:

```diff
- return totalSupply() == 0 ? 1e18 : (balance() * 1e18) / totalSupply();

+ return totalSupply() == 0 ? 10**underlying.decimals() : (balance() * 1e18) / totalSupply();
```
