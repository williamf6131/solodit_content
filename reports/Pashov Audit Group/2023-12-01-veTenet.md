## High Risk

### [C-01] Cloning a `subGauge` can result in an uninitialized proxy

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as `subGauge` initialization can be front-ran

**Likelihood:**
High, as every new `subGauge` will be vulnerable

**Description**

In `GaugeFactory::createSubGauge`, the `Clones::cloneDeterministic` method is used to deploy a new `subGauge`. The problem is, in contrast to `GaugeFactory::createGaugeProxyAndSubGauges`, in `createSubGauge` the `subGauge` is not initialized after cloning, which leaves it vulnerable to a front-running attack. Example scenario:

1. Alice calls `GaugeFactory::createSubGauge` to deploy a new `subGauge`
2. The `subGauge` is added to a `GaugeProxy` by calling `GaugeProxy::addSubGauge`
3. Now Alice sends a transaction to call `initialize` on the `subGauge`
4. Bob sees Alice's transaction and front-runs it, initializing it with his own supplied arguments (`stakingToken`, `governance` etc), so he controls it

**Recommendations**

Initialize a newly cloned `subGauge` in `GaugeFactory::createSubGauge` in the same way that it is done in `GaugeFactory::createGaugeProxyAndSubGauges`.

### [C-02] Codebase is using a vulnerable Vyper compiler version

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as reentrancy in methods that forbid it is possible

**Likelihood:**
High, as the bytecode will always be vulnerable when compiled with that compiler version

**Description**

A month ago we saw a major exploit in the Ethereum ecosystem due to a bug in the Vyper compiler, as explained [here](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-vyper-bug-hack-july-2023). The Vyper team had the `@nonreentrant` annotation (or a function decorator) built natively into the language itself, but in version 0.2.15 a bug was introduced, essentially resulting in no reentrancy protection even if the annotation is used on a method. As stated [here](https://hackmd.io/@vyperlang/HJUgNMhs2#:~:text=All%20Vyper%20contracts%20that%20have,the%20malfunctioning%20re%2Dentrancy%20guard.), "All Vyper contracts that have been compiled with versions v0.2.15, v0.2.16, and v0.3.0 are vulnerable to the malfunctioning re-entrancy guard.".

The Vyper files in the repository (apart from `BoostDelegationV2`) all have compiler version 0.2.16, which is also configured in `hardhat.config.ts`. There are multiple methods marked with `@nonreentrant` in `GaugeController`, `LiquidityGaugeV4` and `VotingEscrow`. All of those method are not reentrancy protected.

**Recommendations**

Upgrade all Vyper contracts' compiler version to at least v0.3.1, where the bug was fixed.

### [C-03] New `subGauge`s can't be used by the protocol

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as important protocol functionality is not working

**Likelihood:**
High, as the bug will happen every time

**Description**

The `createSubGauge` method in `GaugeFactory` creates a new `subGauge` but does not actually add the `subGauge` to the `GaugeProxy` as it is done in `createGaugeProxyAndSubGauges`. Even though the `GaugeProxy` contract has an `addSubGauge` method, it is only callable by the `gaugeFactory` or by the `TLSDFactory`. Neither contracts have an actual way to directly call the `addSubGauge` method, which means that even though you can create new `subGauge`s you can't actually add them to the `GaugeProxy` in any way.

**Recommendations**

Change the `createSubGauge` method to execute the same `GaugeProxy(_gaugeProxy).addSubGauge(_stakingTokens[i], subGauge);` call as in `createGaugeProxyAndSubGauges` with the given `_stakingToken` argument.

### [H-01] Changing the reward rate results in non-claimable yield

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as accrued rewards won't be distributed to validators

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it requires method to be called in a specific order

**Description**

The `setDailyRewardRate` in `RewardVault` resets the `lastReward` storage variable to the current day. This means that now when `RewardVault::distributeRewards` is called, only the duration since the latest `setDailyRewardRate` call and the current moment will be used to calculate the accrued rewards. The problem with this approach is if that before calling `setDailyRewardRate` there were accrued but unclaimed rewards, those rewards will not be claimable anymore and the validators will lose on them.

**Recommendations**

Call `distributeRewards` before you update `lastReward` in `setDailyRewardRate`. This should only be done when `lastReward` has already been set.

## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Input is insufficiently validated in multiple methods

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as it can result of loss of accrued yield for validators or DoS of the protocol

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires configuration error by `Governance` or `TLSDFactory` or them being malicious or compromised

**Description**

The input validation of multiple methods throughout the codebase is insufficient:

- In `RewardDistributor::setScanPeriod` if the `_newScanPeriod` argument is too big of a number it can result in a DoS in the `_distribute` method, and if it is too small it can result in lost unclaimed yield for validators
- In `GaugeProxy::setValidatorFee` if the `_fee` argument is more than `FEE_BASE` it will result in a DoS in `distributeToken` and also if it is equal to `FEE_BASE` it will result in the whole `rewardAmount` getting sent to the `validatorFeeRecipient` address
- In `TenetVesting::initialize` the `cliff`, `vestingPeriod` and `startTime` inputs are not properly validated and can contain too big values which can result in stuck funds in the contract if `revocable == false`

**Recommendations**

For the `scanPeriod`, make sure to not allow too big of a value and also to be certain that validators won't be using unclaimed yield. For the `validatorFee` cap it to some sensible value, possibly 10%. For the vesting parameters make sure that the `cliff` isn't too big, same for the `vestingPeriod` and also make sure that `startTime` isn't too further away in the future or already passed.

### [M-02] Non-standard ERC20 tokens will be stuck in contracts

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as it will result in stuck funds

**Likelihood:**
Low, as only some tokens that might not actually be used will be problematic

**Description**

Tokens like `USDT` do not return a `bool` on `ERC20::transfer` call, while others do not revert on a failed transfer but just return `false`. Those types of tokens are not properly supported in `VestRewardReceiver::sendTokens` and `TenetVesting::rescueFunds`, as the code in those methods uses the normal `ERC20::transfer` method without accounting for them. This can result in inability to call `rescueFunds` for `USDT` for example in `TenetVesting`, which will result in stuck funds.

**Recommendations**

Use the OpenZeppelin `SafeERC20` library instead and change the `transfer` calls to `safeTransfer` to support those non-standard ERC20 tokens as well.

### [M-03] Validator fee will be lost if recipient is not set

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as it will result in a loss of yield for a validator

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a specific scenario

**Description**

In `GaugeProxy::distributeToken` rewards are distributed to gauges based on validator activity. Also some fee is taken, called a `validatorFee`, and sent to a different recipient for each validator. The problem is that the code doesn't check if a `validatorFeeRecipient` has been set - if it hasn't been then the `fee` would be burned (sent to the zero address).

**Recommendations**

Before doing `IERC20Metadata(tenet).transfer(validatorFeeRecipient[validators[i]], fee);` make sure to check if `validatorFeeRecipient[validators[i]] != address(0)` to not burn the `fee` sent.

### [M-04] The `owner` of `AddressRegistry` can take over the protocol

**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as funds can be stolen

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malicious or a compromised `owner` of `AddressRegistry`

**Description**

Currently most contracts have critical methods only callable by the `GOVERNANCE` account. This account can be set or updated at anytime by the `owner` of the `AddressRegistry` contract, which allows him to set an address that he controls and then exploit all protected methods' functionality for his own gain, for example making him the only recipient of rewards in the protocol.

**Recommendations**

The `owner` of the `AddressRegistry` contract should be a `Timelock` contract that is controlled by a multi-sig or a `Governor` smart contract so that actual attacks will be done slow enough so that users will have time to possibly stop using the protocol or withdraw funds from it.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] A paused `RewardVault` shouldn't allow setting reward rate

The `RewardVault` contract has a `pause` mechanism, which allows the contract to do nothing when `distributeRewards` is called. The problem with this is that the `setDailyRewardRate` is still callable when the contract is paused, which shouldn't be the case. Make sure to check the `isPaused` flag in `RewardVault::setDailyRewardRate` as well and revert when it is equal to `true`.

### [L-02] A killed `TenetVesting` should have `withdrawable` return 0

The `TenetVesting` contract has a `kill` mechanism, which allows a vesting schedule to be revoked. Almost all methods check for the `isKilled` flag and if it is equal to `true` they revert, apart from the `withdrawable` method. To be precise, the method should return 0 when `isKilled == true`.

### [L-03] Iterating over unbounded arrays can result in DoS

The `GaugeProxy` contract has the `addSubGauge` method which pushes new elements to the `gauges` and `stakingTokens` arrays. Both of those arrays' sizes should be capped due to the fact that if too many items are added to them then iterating over the arrays can become too costly in terms of gas and if the amount of gas needed is over the block gas limit this will result in a state of DoS for the methods that do this. While there is a `removeSubGauge` method, it also iterates over the arrays, so it is suboptimal. Your best approach is to introduce `MAX_GAUGES_COUNT` and `MAX_STAKING_TOKENS_COUNT` constant values to cap the sizes of the arrays.

### [L-04] Inconsistent `salt` argument when cloning `subGauge`s

In `GaugeFactory` there is cloning of `subGauge`s both in `createGaugeProxyAndSubGauges` and in `createSubGauge`, but the way the `salt` argument for the cloning is computed is different. This can result in multiple `subGauge`s created for the same `stakingToken`, which shouldn't be the case. Make sure the `salt` is computed in the same way consistently.

### [L-05] No way to withdraw funds during emergency in `RewardVault`

The `RewardVault` contract has pausing functionality which is expected to be called when there is some kind of an emergency, for example a possible vulnerability discovered in the contract. You should add a ways to withdraw the funds out of the contract in such case after pausing it, otherwise they can be stolen by back-running an unpause transaction to the contract. Consider changing the pausing functionality to only be set once and if it is set to `true` to have a separate method to withdraw the funds from.

### [L-06] Implementation contract can be initialized

The `GaugeProxy` contract is an implementation contract that is expected to be used through a proxy. Since implementation contracts shouldn't be used, it is a convention to disallow their initialization. Consider adding an empty constructor that calls `_disableInitializers()` in `GaugeProxy`, as well as in `TenetVesting` and `VestRewardReceiver`.

### [L-07] Use a two-step `governance` role transfer pattern

The `VestFactory::setGovernance` uses a single-step access control transfer pattern. This means that if the current `governance` account calls `setGovernance` with an incorrect address, then this `governance` role will be lost forever along with all the functionality that depends on it. Follow the pattern from OpenZeppelin's [Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) and implement a two-step transfer pattern for the action.
