## Medium Risk

### NMC-2 | Weak Tokenomics Protection

**Description**

The `MAX_ASSIGNER_CREDITS` and `MAX_CREDITS_ASSIGNED` offer little to no protection for the protocol tokenomics.
The `MAX_ASSIGNER_CREDITS` can be easily circumvented by simply calling the `addAssignerCredits` multiple times.
The `MAX_CREDITS_ASSIGNED` can be easily circumvented by calling the `assignNamingCredits` function multiple times or calling `assignNamingCreditsBulk` with a `user` list that contains the same address multiple times.
Therefore it is relatively easy for the `tempAdmin` and `assigners` to manipulate the tokenomics of the project, potentially creating unlimited naming credits or allowing a particular address to accumulate more than the intended amount of naming credits.

**Recommendation**

Base the `MAX_ASSIGNER_CREDITS` and `MAX_CREDITS_ASSIGNED` on the assigner/user balance and possibly introduce a hard cap on the number of `namingCredits` that can be in circulation to prevent an unexpected amount of `namingCredits` being created.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

## Low Risk

### NMC-1 | Centralization Risk

**Description**

`tempAdmin` has the ability to essentially mint unlimited naming credits (further discussed on NMC-2), as well as control over numerous functions which could negatively affect the rest of the protocol: `setRNMAddress`, `shutOffFeeRecipientUpdates`, `addAssignerCredits`, `nullAssignerCredits`, `shutOffAssignerAssignments`, `transferTempAdmin`.

**Recommendation**

Ensure `tempAdmin` is a multi-sig.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- `tempAdmin` will be a multi-sig.

### NMC-3 | Zero Address Checks

**Description**

The `constructor`, `transferTempAdmin`, and `updateProtocolFeeRecipient` functions all assign important address contract variables without ensuring any of them are not the zero address.

**Recommendation**

Evaluate whether or not each of these addresses can be assigned to the zero/dead address and add prohibiting requires statements accordingly.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-4 | Superfluous Code

**Description**

The `currencyQuantity` parameter is required to be equal to `numberOfCredits * nftrAddress.namingPriceEther()` in the `BuyWithEth.YES` case, and equal to `numberOfCredits * nftrAddress.namingPriceRNM()` in the `BuyWithEth.NO` case.

Therefore all subsequent computations of `numberOfCredits * nftrAddress.namingPriceEther()` or `numberOfCredits * nftrAddress.namingPriceRNM()` can be replaced with the `currencyQuantity`.

**Recommendation**

Implement the above simplifications.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-5 | Superfluous Code

**Description**

In `buyNamingCredits`, the `require` statements inside of the first `if` statement can be moved into the `if` statement below. This way the `buyWithEth` type can be checked just once.

**Recommendation**

Implement the above simplifications.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-6 | Unnecessary Require Statements

**Description**

There are several `require` statements that appear directly before a `transferFrom` function call or `-=` operator that would otherwise revert without the presence of the `require` statement.

**Recommendation**

Remove the unnecessary require statements and optionally replace each `-=` with a `.sub` alternative if the revert messages are necessary.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- Acknowledged, but left as is for simplicity.

### NMC-7 | Unnecessary Casting

**Description**

The `nftrAddress` and `rnmAddress` variables are stored as `INFTRegistry` and `IRNM` types in the contract, however they are often redundantly cast to `INFTRegistry` and `IRNM` types in the `buyNamingCredits` function.

**Recommendation**

Remove the redundant casts.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-8 | Typo

**Description**

On line 120, “buy” is misspelled as “by”.

**Recommendation**

Replace “by” with “buy” in the comment.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-9 | Default Value Assignment

**Description**

On line 195 the `uint` variable i is initialized to the default value of 0.

**Recommendation**

Remove the unnecessary assignment.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:
The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-10 | Cache Array Length

**Description**

Caching the array length outside a `for` loop saves reading it on each iteration.

**Recommendation**

Declare a `len` variable and use it as the upper bound in the `for` loop.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-11 | Uint Comparisons

**Description**

When dealing with unsigned integer types, comparisons with `!= 0` are cheaper than with `> 0`.

**Recommendation**

Replace the `assigners[msg.sender] > 0` check with `assigners[msg.sender] != 0`.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-12 | Storage Modifiers

**Description**

In `assignNamingCreditsBulk` the `address[] memory user` and `address[] memory numberOfCredits` parameters are never altered and therefore can be declared `calldata`.

**Recommendation**

Declare the variables `calldata`.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-13 | Shorten Revert Strings

**Description**

Throughout the contract revert strings that are longer than 32 bytes are used.

**Recommendation**

Shorten revert strings to less than 32 bytes to save on gas.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- Acknowledged, but left as is for simplicity.

### NMC-14 | Access Modifiers

**Description**

Throughout the contract there are several require statements that assert the `msg.sender` is the `tempAdmin`. These `require` statements can be deduplicated into a single `onlyTempAdmin` modifier that can be used on each of these functions.

**Recommendation**

Create an `onlyTempAdmin` modifier and apply it to each of these functions.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-15 | Duplicate Reads

**Description**

In `assignNamingCreditsBulk` the `numberOfCredits[i]` value is read up to five times upon each iteration. Declare a `uint creditNum` outside of the `for` loop and cache the `numberOfCredits` value in it upon each iteration.

**Recommendation**

Implement the above suggestion.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:
The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-16 | For-Loop Increment

**Description**

Because the `user` array’s length is bound by `MAX_BULK_ASSIGNMENT`, there is no risk of overflow. To reduce bytecode, use an unchecked block in the loop to increment.

**Recommendation**

Implement the above suggestion.

**Resolution**

NFTR Team:

- The suggested changes were implemented.

### NMC-17 | Custom Reverts

**Description**

Since Solidity v0.8.4, the more gas-efficient custom-errors have been introduced. They allow for passing dynamic data in the error and remove costly and repeated string error messages.

**Recommendation**

Consider replacing `require` statements with custom errors.
