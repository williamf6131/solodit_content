# Findings

## High Risk

### GG-2 | Reenter Dividends

**Description**

Because the dividends paid to a user is only updated after the external call sending them funds, it is possible for a malicious contract to re-enter and keep draining `div` amount of BNB on each call.

**Recommendation**

Add a `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard or utilize the check-effects-interactions pattern.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Added the `lock` modifier to `deposit`, `depositLocked`, `relock`, and `withdraw`.

### PAIR-1 | Duplicate Dividends

**Description**

In the `mint` function, the only precondition for adding an address to the `users` list is if the balance of the address is 0. Additionally, an address is not removed from the `users` list if it transfers it’s balance of the BridgesPair token.
This way an address can continually `mint` and transfer/burn it’s tokens to enter the `users` list multiple times. Multiple entries in the users list will result in multiple dividends being paid out in the `distributeDividends` function.

**Recommendation**

Add a check for addresses that are already in the `users` list.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Dividends have been refactored to a dividendsPerShare implementation.

### PAIR-2 | DoS Dividends

**Description**

Due to the unbounded `for` loop in `distributeDividends`, there is a risk of a DoS attack. A malicious party can keep generating new addresses and minting minimal amounts of the BridgesPair token to make `distributeDividends` exceed the block gas limit, stopping all dividends.

**Recommendation**

Process the users in smaller batches, set a cap on number of users who can receive dividends, or modify the dividend allocation logic entirely such that a `for` loop is not needed.

For an alternative approach, see this “pointsPerShare” implementation: https://github.com/indexed-finance/dividends/tree/master/contracts

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Dividends have been refactored to a dividendsPerShare implementation.

## Medium Risk

### GLOBAL-1 | Centralization Risk

**Description**

Privileged addresses have authority over many functions that may be used to negatively disrupt the project. Some important privileges include:

**GoldenGate**

- `owner` can withdraw all funds.
- `owner` can set admins which are able to dilute allocation of other pools.
- `owner` can set the migrator contract which can lead to loss of LP if malicious.

**TokenVesting**

- `owner` can arbitrarily set the fee and fee address which can lead to loss of user funds.

**BridgesRef**

- `feeToSetter` can arbitrarily set the distribution rate.
- `feeToSetter` can withdraw any ERC-20 token in the contract.

**BridgesRouter**

- `feeSetter` can set a arbitrary referral and dividend tracker contract.

**BridgesFactory**

- `feeToSetter` can set an arbitrary start time for when a pair can be tradeable.

**Recommendation**

Ensure that the privileged addresses are multi-sig and/or introduce timelock for improved community oversight. Optionally introduce `require` statements to limit the scope of the exploits that can be carried out by the privileged addresses.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- All centralized BNB and token withdrawal functions have been removed from the GoldenGate contract,
- The possibility to change fees on the TokenVault has been removed as well.
- The GoldenGate migrator has to be there for an eventual V2 in the future.
- For the same reason all update functions on the tracker are necessary.
- Every privileged address will be a multi-sig with trusted members in production.

### GG-1 | DoS Dividends

**Description**

Due to the unbounded `for` loop in `distributeDividends`, there is a risk of a DoS attack. Anytime a new address deposits to pool 0, they are added to the `usersBridges` list. A malicious party can keep generating new addresses and deposit miniscule amounts of LP to make `distributeDividends` exceed the block gas limit, stopping all dividends.

**Recommendation**

Process the users in smaller batches, set a cap on number of users who can receive dividends, or modify the dividend allocation logic entirely such that a `for` loop is not needed.

For an alternative approach, see this “pointsPerShare” implementation: https://github.com/indexed-finance/dividends/tree/master/contracts

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- The dividend distribution mechanism was updated to a dividendsPerShare model.

### GG-3 | Shorten Lock

**Description**

In the `transferLock` function `_to.stakeUntil` is set to `_from.stakeUntil`. Therefore, it is possible to shorten the lock period by transferring from an address with a shorter lock to an address with a longer lock.

**Recommendation**

When transferring a lock, adopt a push then pull pattern where the receiver needs to accept an incoming lock, and then adopt the longer lock period when combining locks. Alternatively, make each lock its own unique NFT token.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Now requires that the `_to.amount = 0`.

### GG-4 | DoS Deposit and Withdraw

**Description**

Because depositing and withdrawing from pool 0 relies on a successful BNB transfer for the dividends payment, it is possible to prevent deposits and withdrawals. If a user were to drain the BNB from the contract using the re-entrancy described earlier or the owner drained the BNB using the `BNB` function, then the `call` would fail and the transaction would revert.

**Recommendation**

Refactor the dividend payments so they are separate from withdrawals and deposits.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Dividends have been refactored and the emergency BNB function has been removed.

### GG-5 | Dividend Sniping

**Description**

Because it is possible to publicly see transactions that are sending value to `distributeDividends`, bots can frontrun the distribution. This way addresses may sandwich a deposit and withdrawal around a distribution in order to unfairly accumulate dividends while never effectively holding the token.

**Recommendation**

Introduce a warmup period, or require locking for dividends.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- We think this is unlikely as it would require swapping for tokens and providing/removing liquidity to achieve a return, it would likely be gas/slippage cost prohibitive.

### BRT-1 | Unable to Swap ETH

**Description**

Because the trading fee `tradingFee` is taken before `amounts` is calculated, there may not be enough BNB to deposit into the WBNB contract. Thus, the transaction will revert and the swap will fail.

**Recommendation**

Take the trading fee after the swap has occurred, or account for the trading fee in `getAmountsIn`.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Added amounts adjustment for the fee.

### BRF-1 | Accidental Magnification

**Description**

In the `distribute` function each `user.earned` amount is multiplied by the `disRate` but in the withdraw function, the `user.earned` amount is not divided by some divisor that corresponds to the `disRate`.

**Recommendation**

Add a divisor for the `disRate` and use it to adjust `user.earned` values in either the `distribute` or `withdraw` functions as needed.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- This is intended behavior, we treat the disRate as a multiplier.

### BRF-2 | Unbounded disRate

**Description**

There is no bound to how high the `disRate` variable can be set in the `setDisRate` function. Therefore, the distributed amount in the `distribute` function may exceed the provided `amount`.

**Recommendation**

Implement a maximum cap for `disRate`. A cap of ~ 57% (1/1.75) would allow for a maximum distribution of `amount`.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Set a disRate cap of 1000.

## Low Risk

### GG-6 | Redundant Boolean Check

**Description**

The check `user.alreadyHere ==` false can be simplified to `!user.alreadyHere`.

**Recommendation**

Replace `user.alreadyHere == false` with `!user.alreadyHere`.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- The simplification was made.

### GG-7 | Typo

**Description**

Withdraw is spelled `witdhraw` in the error message on line 265.

**Recommendation**

Correct it to `withdraw`.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Typo has been fixed.

### GG-8 | Duplicate Code Lines

**Description**

The statement `user.rewardDebt = user.amount.mul(pool.accBRGPerShare).div(1e12)` is repeated on line 275.

**Recommendation**

Remove the first occurrence on line 273.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- The first duplicate was removed.

### GG-9 | Superfluous Code

**Description**

In the emergencyWithdraw function, the statement `user.userLockedAmount = user.userLockedAmount.sub(user.userLockedAmount)` is equivalent to `user.userLockedAmount = 0`.

**Recommendation**

Replace the inefficient statement with `user.userLockedAmount = 0`.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Updated to `= 0`.

### GG-10 | Cannot Withdraw Max Amount

**Description**

In the `Bep20` and `BNB` functions the `require` statements specify a value `<` the contract balance, meanwhile it may be intended to remove a value equal to the contract balance.

**Recommendation**

Confirm whether or not the exact contract balance should be able to be withdrawn and optionally update accordingly.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Updated to `<=`

### GG-11 | Superfluous Code

**Description**

In the `Bep20` function the `payable` cast on line 331 is unnecessary as the `safeTransfer` function simply accepts an address.

**Recommendation**

Remove the `payable` cast.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:
-Removed the payable cast.

### GG-12 | Lack of camelCase

**Description**

The function `pendingbridges` does not abide by camelCase naming conventions.

**Recommendation**

Rename it to `pendingBridges`.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- The function has been renamed.

### TV-1 | Setting Default Values

**Description**

The `shares` variable is initialized to 0. This is unnecessary because the default value for the `uint256` type is 0.

**Recommendation**

Remove the assignment.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Removed the assignment.

### BRF-3 | Superfluous Code

**Description**

The `Distributed` variable is not referenced at all.

**Recommendation**

Remove the `Distributed` variable.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- The variable has been removed.

### BRF-4 | Typo

**Description**

The `withelistTokens`, `withelistUsers`, and `withelistUser` functions all have a typo.

**Recommendation**

Correct them to `whitelistTokens`, `whitelistUsers`, and `whitelistUser`.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Typos have been corrected.

### BRF-5 | Cannot Withdraw Max Amount

**Description**

In the `withdraw` function the `require` statement specifies a value `<` the contract balance, meanwhile it may be intended to remove a value equal to the contract balance.

**Recommendation**

Confirm whether or not the exact contract balance should be able to be withdrawn and optionally update accordingly.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Updated to `<=` to be able to withdraw the max amount.

### FACT-1 | Unimplemented Interface Methods

**Description**

The `BridgesFactory` contract fails to provide implementations for the `feeTo`, `tradingStart`, and `setFeeTo` functions defined in the `IBridgesFactory` interface.

**Recommendation**

Either add implementations for these functions in the `BridgesFactory` contract or remove them from the `IBridgesFactory` interface.

**Resolution**

Bridges Team:

- Unimplemented functions have been removed from the interface.
