## High Risk

### ORDU-1 | Limit Increase With Same Block Pricing

**Description**

In `validateOracleBlockNumbersForPosition`, both conditionals on lines 295 and 306 handle the `LimitIncrease` order type but with different oracle block requirements. 
During execution, the first `if` statement is entered, therefore a `LimitIncrease` order is forced to use prices where the `oracleBlockNumbers` are equal to the `orderUpdatedAtBlock`. This contradicts the behavior outlined in the Order.sol documentation where:

“LimitSwap and LimitIncrease orders can always be executed if the right prices are reached due to this, validating that the prices presented are for blocks **after the order's updatedAtBlock** should be sufficient to prevent gaming of the pricing”.

Because `LimitIncrease` orders can only be executed with prices from their `updatedAtBlock` they are rendered nearly useless.

**Recommendation**

Remove `LimitIncrease` from the first conditional, as it is currently duplicated.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### GLOBAL-1 | Market Used as Limit
**Description - [PoC](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/GMX/blob/af740b1972788f429219d1381183c68b244e00d8/test/guardianTestSuite/testPOCS.js#L220)**

A `MarketIncrease` order can mimic a limit order by specifying a `minOutputAmount` to fabricate a limit price. However, `MarketIncrease` orders will always be executed at the current market price, rather than limit and stop loss orders which always execute at the `acceptablePrice`. This behavior allows traders to obtain an unfair advantage as they can now have a market order acting as a traditional limit order (execution price <= `acceptablePrice`) rather than simply using a limit order (execution price == `acceptablePrice`). Combined with a stop loss, risk-free trades could be made.

Consider the following scenario:
- The current price of ETH is $2,000
- User A creates a stop-loss order for ETH at $1,800
- User A creates a market order for ETH with a `minOutputAmount` such that the market order is only executable when ETH is at or below the price of $1,800.
- The price of ETH drops to $1,700
- The market increase order is then executed at $1,700 while the stop-loss order is executed at the guaranteed $1,800
- User A is able to profit $100/ETH risk free.

**Recommendation**

Consider cancelling the `MarketIncrease` order if the `minOutputAmount` is not met. Alternatively, standardize the behavior of limit and stop loss orders so that they behave similarly to a `MarketIncrease` order with a `minOutputAmount`, taking the current price when it is `<=` the `acceptablePrice` rather than taking the `acceptablePrice`. However, protocol gaming would have to be taken into account.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: `MarketIncrease` orders are now cancelled when the `minOutputAmount` is not met.

### GLOBAL-2 | Delay Limit Success
**Description - [PoC1](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/GMX/blob/af740b1972788f429219d1381183c68b244e00d8/test/guardianTestSuite/testPOCS.js#L522) [PoC2](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/GMX/blob/af740b1972788f429219d1381183c68b244e00d8/test/guardianTestSuite/testPOCS.js#L841)**


The try/catch block in each handler does not catch any errors related to a [Panic exception](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require) or custom revert. This enables a number of bugs and exploits on the exchange.

Most notably, It is possible to create a `LimitIncrease` order that exceeds the max reserved usd, therefore reverting on execution but remaining in the order store, then when conditions are favorable the user can deposit enough reserves so their order gets executed.

Consider the following scenario:
- The current price of ETH is $2,000
- User A creates a `LimitIncrease` long order for ETH at $2,000 in block 100 with usd size larger than allowable
- User A’s order reverts due to insufficient reserves but remains in the order store
- 20 blocks later ether is now $2,100
- User A deposits enough reserves to execute their `LimitIncrease`
- The `LimitIncrease` long order now executes with the prices from block 101
- User A closes their position making risk free profit

**Recommendation**

Utilize `catch (bytes memory lowLevelData)` to catch Panic exceptions and custom reverts.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### DOU-1 | Partial Decrease Block Not Updated
**Description - [PoC](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/GMX/blob/af740b1972788f429219d1381183c68b244e00d8/test/guardianTestSuite/testPOCS.js#L684)**

Decrease orders that are partially filled are not removed from the `orderStore` and continue to exist in perpetuity. However the amount the phantom decrease position order is left with is equivalent to the amount your position was just decreased by not the amount that is leftover from the original decrease position order.

Additionally, because the order is not touched upon a partial decrease order, it is possible for a user to continually submit increase orders and realize immediate and risk-free profits.

Consider the  following scenario:
- The current price of ETH is $2,000
- User A creates a `MarketIncrease` long order for ETH at $2000 with $1,000,000 `sizeInUSD`
- User A’s position is opened with a size of $1,000,000, and increases to a size of $1,050,000 when ETH reaches a price of $2,100
- User A sends a `MarketDecrease` order with `sizeDeltaUSD` $1,050,001 when ETH is $2,100
- User A’s position is closed but the decrease order remains in the store for $1,050,000
- The phantom `MarketDecrease` is not touched, therefore it must be executed at $2,100
- User A submits a `MarketIncrease`  long order when ETH is back at $2,000 for $1,049,999
- The newly created position is closed by the `MarketDecrease` order at $2,100 for immediate profit
- The `MarketDecrease` order continues to exist in the `orderStore`, and as long as the price of ETH is below the decrease order price, the user can keep submitting large longs and realizing profit

**Recommendation**

Do not allow partially fulfilled orders to remain in the `orderStore`, or fix the partial fulfillment logic and address the block number at which these partially fulfilled orders can be executed at.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Partially filled orders are now touched upon execution.

### BNK-1 | Bank Cannot Receive ETH
**Description - [PoC](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/GMX/blob/af740b1972788f429219d1381183c68b244e00d8/test/guardianTestSuite/testPOCS.js#L99)**
Bank.sol has no receive/fallback function defined to be able to accept ether, therefore it is impossible for the Bank to withdraw ether from the WETH contract and by extension it is impossible to transfer ether out of the Bank.sol contract.

Because of this:
- Swap orders with `hasCollateralInEth == true` lead to complete loss of funds for users.
- Orders, deposits, and withdrawals using `hasCollateralInEth == true` are unable to be canceled. This means users are unable to cancel `hasCollateralInEth` orders and the keeper is unable to cancel failing orders, deposits, and withdrawals leading to phantom entries in each corresponding store.
- `StopLoss` orders with no `swapPath` and `hasCollateralInEth == true` cannot be executed as they attempt to pay the user in ether from the bank.
- Additionally, users are unable to use the `hasCollateralInEth` flag to receive ether when withdrawing or exercising a decrease order.

**Recommendation**

Implement a receive function in the Bank.sol contract.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### DOU-2 | Loss of Funds on Swap Path
**Description - [PoC](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/GMX/blob/af740b1972788f429219d1381183c68b244e00d8/test/guardianTestSuite/testPOCS.js#L974)**

For decrease orders with a defined `swapPath` the `inputAmount` for the swap is the `initialCollateralDeltaAmount`, which cannot be set for decrease order types and defaults to 0.
Therefore, if a user supplies a `swapPath` on a decrease order, they will experience a complete loss of funds. Zero tokens would be swapped and sent back to the user, yet their position would still decrease/close.

**Recommendation**

Provide the correct `inputAmount` for the swap that corresponds to how much the user’s position was decreased by.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### MKTU-1 | Pool Value With Inverse PnL
**Description - [PoC](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/GMX/blob/af740b1972788f429219d1381183c68b244e00d8/test/guardianTestSuite/testPOCS.js#L1152)**

The pool value interprets traders profiting as an increase of value for the pool, and traders losing as a decrease of value of the pool. This is exactly the inverse of what should be happening. When traders lose and their loss is realized, their collateral is taken into the pool and the value of the pool increases.

**Recommendation**

Use `return Calc.sum(value, -pnl)`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### LIQH-1 | Uninitialized Order Store
**Description**

The liquidation handler has no reference to the `orderStore`, and does not assign one in the params to `processLiquidation`. Therefore, liquidations revert when attempting to access the `orderstore` on the `ExecuteOrderParams` params. Therefore it is impossible to perform liquidations on any position.

**Recommendation**

Include the `orderStore` in the `ExecuteOrderParams` in the `liquidatePosition` function.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### LIQH-2 | Incorrect Blocks For Liquidation
**Description**

In `processLiquidation`, the `marketDecrease` order that is created for liquidation does not get touched, therefore the `updatedAtBlock` is always 0.

Therefore it is impossible to execute a liquidation with the correct block number for oracle prices and by extension impossible to liquidate any position.

Furthermore, the `oracleBlockNumber` requirements for a `MarketDecrease` order stipulate that the prices come from the block in which the order was updated at. This would demand that the oracle provide finalized prices for the block in which the liquidation transaction is to be executed, which is impossible as the block has not yet been confirmed.

**Recommendation**

Resolve the contradiction in block numbers for liquidations and `MarketDecrease` orders. Additionally, make sure to call `touch()` on the order when creating it in the `processLiquidation` function.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### GLOBAL-3 | Cannot Withdraw Backed Position
**Description - [PoC](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/GMX/blob/af740b1972788f429219d1381183c68b244e00d8/test/guardianTestSuite/testPOCS.js#L585)**

If a user creates a long position with the short token as collateral,  they may only withdraw the long token or short token if there is enough short token liquidity in the pool. This can lead to circumstances where users are unable to withdraw from their positions even though they are technically backed.

This is because positions are keyed based on the `initialCollateralToken` and decrease orders must specify the same `initialCollateralToken` so there must exist enough short token liquidity to pay out the position for a decrease order.

This is strange as long positions are backed by long tokens, thus the user should be able to withdraw the long token upon decrease without relying on adequate short token liquidity to perform a swap. 

**Recommendation**

Allow users to withdraw the long token in this case, or prevent such a scenario from happening in the first place in the `validateReserves` function.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Users profits are now paid in their backing PnL token.

### ORDH-1 | Waste Keeper Gas
**Description - [PoC](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/GMX/blob/af740b1972788f429219d1381183c68b244e00d8/test/guardianTestSuite/testPOCS.js#L1211)**

An order’s `executionFee` is validated when the keeper is already attempting to execute the order. A malicious user can send a large number of orders that are unable to be executed and have an `executionFee` of 0.

This will waste the keeper’s gas at no cost to the user each time execution is attempted, potentially delaying the execution of other deposits, withdrawals, and orders on the exchange.

**Recommendation**

Validate the `executionFee` upon order creation, similarly to deposits.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### FR-1 | Cannot Withdraw Fees
**Description**

The `FeeReceiver` contract is responsible for receiving fees for the entire protocol, but provides no functions to retrieve erc20 tokens nor ether. Therefore any fees sent to the `FeeReceiver` contract are lost.

**Recommendation**

Add a withdraw function with proper access controls to withdraw and manage fees.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### GLOBAL-4 | Arbitrage Attack
**Description**

Documentation in README.md suggests that spot prices from multiple exchanges will be used to determine prices for execution. Such a price collection scheme potentially allows for economically viable price manipulation/arbitrage attacks. Attackers may be able to manipulate prices to game orders into guaranteed profits, or cause mass liquidations.

**Recommendation**

Adopt a TWAP with multiple price readings to make such attacks economically unviable. Otherwise, be prepared to use failsafes such as open interest caps to limit these attacks. 
Optionally, order book depth/liquidity for each exchange should be considered in the calculation to further limit the scope of manipulation attacks.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged

## Medium Risk

### GLOBAL-5 | Centralization Risk
**Description**

The exchange keeper and other permissioned addresses have the power to do nearly anything:

- Execute any order or liquidation at any arbitrary price
- Defer execution of any arbitrary deposit, withdrawal, order, or liquidation
- Select the order of execution for all incoming deposits, withdrawals, and orders
- Power to shut off any feature – including withdrawals and closing positions
- Change out the protocol-wide variables used in the `dataStore`

There are many assumptions made on the form of the price input from the keeper. Adding validation for the expected format and range of acceptable inputs would reduce the risk of high-cost mistakes, and assist in limiting the scope of the internal exploits available to the keeper.

The keeper must diligently execute orders, for example stop loss orders must be executed with the correct range of block numbers while staying within the `MAX_ORACLE_BLOCK_AGE` limit.

**Recommendation**

Treat the keeper’s private key(s) with the utmost level of security and introduce as many safeguard checks as possible to limit the scope of the keepers potential attack vectors.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged

### OCL-1 | Potential Gas DoS
**Description**

There is a potential DoS with the `setPrices` function, as the lengths of the `tokens`, `signers`, `compactedOracleBlockNumbers`, and `compactedPrices` arrays are unbounded. The `for` loop through these arrays in addition to memory expansion costs may result in gas fees exceeding the block gas limit, especially with long swap routes that require many token prices.

**Recommendation**

Carefully consider the max signer bounds to limit gas usage. Furthermore, consider bounds on the number of tokens, as all signers are iterated over for each token.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The sizes of these arrays in practice should not come close to the block gas limit.

### FR-2 | Lack of Access Control For Events
**Description**

Anyone can call `notifyFeeReceived` as there is a lack of access control, which leads to a depreciation of the authenticity of the event. 

**Recommendation**

Implement access control concerning who may call `notifyFeeReceived`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### DEPU-1 | Execution Fee DoS
**Description**

There is a potential DoS with `createDeposit`, as a malicious address may send a miniscule amount of WETH to the deposit store such that another user’s WETH deposit no longer matches the `executionFee` in their deposit. Thus, the deposit execution reverts and is unable to be created.

**Recommendation**

Consider removing the strict equality for the `executionFee` or handling the accounting in the `depositStore` such that another address cannot increase the deposit amount for a user.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### ERTR-1 | Missing Validation
**Description**

When creating a deposit, there is no validation that the `longToken` or the `shortToken` are valid for the supplied market. If WBTC is accidentally used as the long token in an ETH/USDC market, the user would lose their WBTC in the `depositStore`.

Furthermore, there is no validation that either the long token amount or short token amount is non-zero. This check should be added to prevent the keeper from executing trivial deposits.

Additionally, when creating an order, there is no validation that the initial collateral token is valid for the provided market, which can lead to invalid orders stored in the `orderStore`.

**Recommendation**

Implement the above mentioned validations.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged

### OCL-2 | Chainlink Feed Validation
**Description**

Extra validation checks should be added on the result from the Chainlink price feed to ensure non-stale data. The price from the data feed influences the execution of orders and liquidations so it is imperative the data is up to date and correct. 

**Recommendation**

Add the following require statements to validate the price feed:
- `require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Chainlink:: Stale price")`
- `require(timestamp > 0, "Chainlink:: Round not complete")`

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### ORDH-2 | Phantom Decrease
**Description**

It is possible to have a decrease order in the `orderStore` when no corresponding position is present because orders are not cancelled upon failure with the `EMPTY_POSITION_ERROR_KEY`.

Consider the following scenario:

- User A creates a position
- User A sends a `LimitDecreaseOrder` and a `MarketDecreaseOrder` in the same block
- `LimitDecreaseOrder` gets executed first
- `MarketDecreaseOrder` is now floating on an empty position and it never gets canceled
- User A opens a new position with an increase order of the same market, collateral token, and directionality
- The market decrease order unexpectedly affects User A’s new position as it was waiting to be executed in the `orderStore`

**Recommendation**

Cancel the order upon failed execution in the case of `EMPTY_POSITION_ERROR_KEY`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### OCL-3 | Block Number Validation
**Description**

According to documentation, the price for a token is only retrieved once a block is finalized.

However, `_setPrices` does not revert when the block number of the prices provided by the oracle equals the current block number: `if (cache.oracleBlockNumber > block.number) { revert … }`.
This allows the keeper to provide prices for a block number that is equivalent to the current block and waste gas when it would likely continue on to revert when validating signatures.

**Recommendation**

Use `>=` instead of `>`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged

### DPU-1 | Unable to Decrease Collateral
**Description**

In the `processCollateral` function, the `collateralDeltaAmount` is initially set to `params.order.initialCollateralDeltaAmount().toInt256()`, which cannot be set for decrease orders. Therefore, there is no way to decrease collateral from a position without closing the entire position.

**Recommendation**

Allow for `initialCollateralDeltaAmount` to be set for decrease orders so users are able to decrease their collateral without closing their position.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### POSU-1 | Cannot Liquidate 0 Remaining Collateral
**Description**

There is potential for a position with $0 of `remainingCollateral` to avoid liquidation. This is due to the fact that the first conditional can avoid being triggered if the `MIN_COLLATERAL_USD` was not set. If so, the second conditional would revert due to division by 0. Thus, a position that is liquidatable cannot be liquidated.

**Recommendation**

Add zero checks for such a scenario.

`if (remainingCollateralUsd == 0) return true;`

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### MKTF-1 | Same Short and Long Token
**Description**

When creating a new market, nothing prevents the long token from being set to the same address as the short token.

In such a case, deposits would double count the funds you are sending to the pool. Since the creation of markets will eventually be unpermissioned, this validation is paramount.

**Recommendation**

Validate that the long token is not equal to the short token.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

## Low Risk

### ORD-1 | Typo
**Description**

On line 58, “current” is misspelled as “curent“.

**Recommendation**

Replace “curent” with “current” in the comment.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### OCL-4 | Jagged Set of Arrays
**Description**

In the `_setPrices` function, nothing prevents the `signatures` array from being a different length than the `signers` array. If there are less signatures than signers, that would lead to an out-of-bounds error and the index price would not be able to get set.

In this case it would save gas to add a length validation check before commencing potentially expensive price computations.

**Recommendation**

Check that the length of the `signatures` array is a multiple of the length of the `signers` array.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The net result of the recommendation is still a reverted transaction, however optimizing for the revert case rather than the expected use case.

### GOV-1 | Pull Over Push Ownership
**Description**

The ownership transfer process should have a push and pull step rather than executing in a single transaction with `setGov`.

This way the protocol may avoid catastrophic errors such as setting the wrong governance address.

**Recommendation**

Implement a two step transfer process for the `gov` role where the new `gov` address must explicitly accept its new role.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### GOV-2 | Zero Address Checks
**Description**

In the `setGov` function there are no zero address checks on the new `gov` address.

**Recommendation**

Add zero address checks as an errantly set `gov` address would be catastrophic for the protocol.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### ERTR-2 | Zero Address Checks
**Description**

The `createDeposit`, `createWithdrawal`, and `createOrder` functions compose the user’s interface for the exchange but perform no zero address checks on the addresses they accept. 

**Recommendation**

Add zero address checks to avoid any unexpected behavior when users interact with these functions. Document where zero addresses are expected, and enforce when they are not.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### GLOBAL-6 | Immutability Modifiers
**Description**

Throughout the contracts many contract level variables can be declared `immutable`. Common variables such as the `dataStore`, `depositHandler`, `withdrawalHandler`, `orderHandler`, `depositStore`, `withdrawalStore`, and `orderStore` among others should be declared `immutable` in multiple contracts.

**Recommendation**

Implement the above recommended immutability modifiers.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### ORDU-2 | Unused Custom Revert
**Description**

In the `setExactOrderPrice` function, the revert statement on line 264 can be replaced with a `revertUnsupportedOrderType` function call.

**Recommendation**

Implement the above function call.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### DEPH-2 | Visibility Modifiers
**Description**

The `_executeDeposit` function is called from within the context of a try/catch, therefore it can be declared `external`.

**Recommendation**

Declare the function `external`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### ORDH-3 | Visibility Modifiers
**Description**

The `_executeOrder` function is called from within the context of a try/catch, therefore it can be declared `external`.

**Recommendation**

Declare the function `external`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### SWU-1 | Redeclared Variables
**Description**

The `market`, `nextIndex`, `receiver`, and `_params` variables can be declared outside of the `for` loop to save gas.

**Recommendation**

Declare these variables outside the `for` loop.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### GLOBAL-8 | Unclear Naming
**Description**

`hasCollateralInEth` is used in many different ways throughout the codebase, it should have a more adaptable/explicit name.

**Recommendation**

Rename `hasCollateralInEth` or assign specific names to use-cases such as deposits and withdrawals.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: `hasCollateralInEth` is now `shouldUnwrapNativeToken`.

### DPU-2 | Redundant Parameters
**Description**

The `processCollateral` function accepts a `position` parameter, but the same position is already available on the `params` parameter of type `DecreasePositionParams`.

**Recommendation**

Remove the `position` parameter as it is available on the `DecreasePositionParams`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### GLOBAL-9 | Flexible Withdrawals
**Description**

It should be noted that when withdrawing `marketTokens`, a user will not always be able to redeem the corresponding amounts of underlying assets that they provided. This is because other depositors may withdraw whichever long or short collateral token they wish, as long as their withdrawal matches the `marketToken` value they received for depositing into the market.

Example:
- The ETH/USD market is empty
- User A deposits $500 worth of ETH and $500 worth of USDC
- User B deposits $500 worth of ETH and $500 worth of USDC
- User A withdraws $1000 worth of USDC
- User B attempts to withdraw $500 worth of ETH and $500 worth of USDC, but the tx reverts because there is no USDC left in the pool

**Recommendation**

Ensure the withdrawal behavior is clearly documented and communicated to users.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: This will be clearly documented for users.

### ORDH-4 | Silent Cancelation
**Description**

When an order is executed and reverts with an error that is not retried, it gets canceled silently. There are no events emitted nor is there a return value for the `executeOrder` function to communicate whether an order was canceled or not.

**Recommendation**

Implement a return value or event that indicates whether or not an order was canceled.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: An event is now emitted upon order cancellation.

### BNK-2 | Duplicate Validation Checks
**Description**

In Bank.sol the `require(receiver != address(this), "Bank: invalid receiver")` check can be deduplicated into a modifier that also validates that the receiver is a non-zero address.

Additionally, these checks can be made in `transferOut` and validate that the amount is greater than zero.

**Recommendation**

Implement the above refactors.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### GLOBAL-10 | Lack Of Events
**Description**

Throughout the contracts there are missing events for important actions such as order execution, position size modifications, liquidations, deposits, and withdrawals.

**Recommendation**

Implement events throughout the contracts for improved monitoring, readability, and transparency.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Events have been added throughout the contracts.

### POSS-1 | Visibility Modifiers
**Description**

The function `contains` is declared as `public` but is never called from within the contract.

**Recommendation**

Modify the visibility from `public` to `external`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### GLOBAL-11 | Storage Location
**Description**

The following parameters are marked as `memory` when they could be declared `calldata`: 
- PositionStore::18
- DepositHandler::73,102
- OrderHandler::58,73,155
- OrderUtils::73
- DepositUtils::61
- DepositStore::17
- WithdrawalUtils::74
- WithdrawalStore::17
- WithdrawalHandler::84,112
- OracleModule::15
- Oracle::82
- LiquidationHandler::51

**Recommendation**

If it is desired to reduce gas for these functions, potentially at the expense of deployment costs, change the suggested memory modifiers from `memory` to `calldata`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### GLOBAL-12 | Default Value Assignment
**Description**

Throughout the contracts `uint` variables are initialized to the default value (0):
- MarketUtils.sol::619
- Oracle.sol::100,136,226,252,285
- OracleUtils.sol::45
- SwapUtils.sol::44
- Timelock.sol::38,44
- Array.sol::33,41,51

**Recommendation**

Remove the unnecessary assignments.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### GLOBAL-13 | Array Length Computations
**Description**

Throughout the contracts array lengths should be computed outside of `for` loops:
- MarketUtils.sol::619
- Oracle.sol::22,100,252,285
- SwapUtils.sol::44
- Timelock.sol::38,44
- Array.sol::33,41,51

**Recommendation**

Compute array lengths outside of `for` loops.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### GLOBAL-14 | Shorten Revert Strings
**Description**

Throughout the contract, revert strings can be shortened to 32 bytes to decrease gas costs:
- WithdrawalHandler.sol::46
- IncreaseOrderUtils.sol::48
- OrderUtils.sol::264
- DecreasePositionUtils.sol::141
- WithdrawalUtils.sol::76,106,204

**Recommendation**

Shorten revert strings to 32 bytes.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### GLOBAL-15 | Division/Multiplication Optimization
**Description**

Throughout the contract, switching from division/multiplication to right-shift/left-shift can save gas:
- PricingUtils.sol::64 
- Array.sol::62,65

**Recommendation**

Switch uses of division to right-shift and uses of multiplication to left-shift.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### DEPU-2 | Recalculating Stored Values
**Description**

In the call to `SwapPricingUtils.GetSwapPricingParams`, the values stored in `longTokenUsd` and `shortTokenUsd` on lines 113 and 114 are recalculated on lines 126 and 127.

**Recommendation**

Use the previously computed values instead of recalculating.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### ORDU-3 | Unnecessary Variable
**Description**

Declaring the `price` variable on line 208 is unnecessary, as the calculated value is only used once.

**Recommendation**

Remove the `price` variable declaration and use the result of the calculation directly.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### IOU-1 | Validation Optimization
**Description**

Validation for the `market` can occur before any transfer logic in order to save gas.

**Recommendation**

Move the `MarketUtils.validateNonEmptyMarket` call to the first line in `processOrder`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### GLOBAL-16 | Custom Reverts
**Description**

Throughout the contracts, several `require` statements can be converted to custom reverts. The following files contain statements that can be replaced:
- OrderUtils.sol::90
- WithdrawalUtils::76,204
- DepositHandler::44
- OrderHandler::53,130
- withdrawalHandler::46
- RoleModule.sol::31,36,41,46,51

**Recommendation**

Replace `require` statements with custom reverts.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: The recommendation was implemented.

### WTDU-1 | Unnecessary Validation
**Description**

`MarketToken.burn` will revert on its own if the user has insufficient market tokens.

**Recommendation**

Remove the validation check if a custom revert is not necessary.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### DPU-3 | Unnecessary Variable Set
**Description**

There is no need to set the position’s `collateralAmount` to 0, as the position is immediately removed on line 99.

**Recommendation**

Remove the line setting the position’s `collateralAmount`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### GLOBAL-17 | For-Loop Increment
**Description**

Throughout the contracts numerous `for` loops have upper bounds with no risk of overflow for the index. Therefore an unchecked block can be used in the loop to increment the index and save gas.

**Recommendation**

Implement the above suggestion.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.

### GLOBAL-18 | Visibility Modifiers
**Description**

Throughout the codebase there are numerous library functions that can be declared `internal` to save gas.

**Recommendation**

Declare library functions that do not need to be called in an `external` context as `internal`.

**Resolution**

GMX Team: Acknowledged.
