# Findings

## Medium Risk

###  Unsafe use of `_mint` instead of  `_safeMint`

**Description:** 

The usage of `_safeMint`guarantees that the receiver `to`address is either a smart contract that implements `IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received`or an EOA. 

**Recommendations:** 

According to OpenZeppelin usage of `_mint`is discouraged,use `_safeMint`whenever possible.

See the docs: [https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_safeMint-address -uint256-](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_safeMint-address-uint256-)



### No cap for Minter

**Description:** 

Since there is no cap for Minter,he could end up reaching `maxSupply` quickly.

**Recommendations:** 

Add a `minterLimit`for Minter roles which will restrict the amount which is allowed to be minted by minter role.



###  `MintStarted`modifier missing

**Description:** 

`MintStarted`modifier is missing meaning the owner can mint even when minting operation is paused.

**Recommendations:** 

Add `MintStarted`modifier in the `mintTo`function.

**Status:** Resolved. 



### No storage gap for upgradeable contracts

**Description:**

1. `__gap` is used in base upgradable contracts to avoid storage clashes while using inheritance.
2. It was observed that both `ERC721ACollection.sol`and `ERC20Token.sol`were missing the `\_\_gap`variable which could lead to collision.

Reference:

[https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-05-alchemix/#m-05-no-storage-gap-for-upgradeab le-contract-might-lead-to-storage-slot-collision](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-05-alchemix/#m-05-no-storage-gap-for-upgradeable-contract-might-lead-to-storage-slot-collision)

**Recommendations:** Recommend adding appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts such as the below

\```

uint256[50]private \_\_gap;

\```



### Unrestricted approval to hardcoded address

**Description:**

1. Give OpenSea full control forever on the users’tokens? What if OpenSea gets hacked?

2. What if the address changes?

3. Deploying with the wrong address by accident and discovering the error later may cause user frustration.

4. Observe that address 0x53d7…96ad is an autoapproved operator,meaning this address can take action on any user NFT.

5. Also [https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x53d791f18155C211FF8b58671d0f7E9b50E596a d#code h](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x53d791f18155C211FF8b58671d0f7E9b50E596ad#code)as unverified code so it’s not possible to know if this contains genuine code.

   

   **Recommendations:**

6. Remove the hardcoded address and let user decide if they want to approve an address to take actions on behalf of their NFT.

7. Or deploy a `ContractRegistry`to handle hardcoded addresses dynamically (keeping in mind that the address OpenSea address is dierent on mumbai).

   

## Low Risk

### Owner should be multisig and should use a timelock

**Description:** 

In the current implementation owner is not a multisig and timelock is not being used.

**Recommendations:** 

Owner should be multisig and timelock should be implemented for better transparency.



### `initialize`function can be frontrun

**Description:** 

Observe that `initialize`function has no modifier to restrict ACLfor the caller, making it available for any user.

**Recommendations:**

For initializing proxy contracts deploy contracts using a factory contract that immediately calls `initialize`after deployment or make sure to call it immediately after deployment and verify the transaction succeeded.



### `initialize`functions not protected

**Description:** 

ERC20Token is an upgradeable contract that does not protect its initialize functions from inherited contracts.

**Recommendations:** 

Add constructor to ERC20 contract as mentioned in the OpenZeppelin docs here:

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable

\```

/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor

constructor(){

\_disableInitializers();

}

\```



### Validation missing on `_initialSupply`

**Description:**

1. Observe that in the `initialize`function `_initialSupply` is not checked to be smaller than or equal to `_maxSupply`.
2. Observe that admin can mistakenly set `_initialSupply`greater than `_maxSupply`which is incorrect behavior.

**Recommendations:** 

Add a check `_initialSupply <= _maxSupply`.



### Basic validation missing on `mint`and `mintTo`

**Description:** 

Observe that both `mint`and `mintTo`functions are missing basic validation for `to`address,amount/quantity.

**Recommendations:** 

Add below to mint &mintTo function at ERC20Token.sol

\```

require(to!=address(0)&&amount>0,""Incorrect params"");

\```

Add below to mint &mintTo function at ERC721ACollection.sol

\```

require(quantity>0 &&to!=address(0),""Incorrect params"");// for mintTo require(quantity>0,""Incorrect params"");// for mint

\```



### `mint`function marked as `payable`

**Description:** 

If value is being passed while calling `mint`,ether will get locked in contract because it is unable to handle native tokens.

**Recommendations:** 

Remove `payable`from function declaration.



## Informational

###  Empty blocks should be removed or emit something

**Description:** 

The function `_authorizeUpgrade()`has an empty block which results in consumption of gas unnecessarily.

**Recommendations:** 

The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist,or the block should do something useful,such as emitting an event or reverting.



###  Use custom errors rather than `require()`strings to save deployment gas

**Description:** 

Starting from Solidity v0.8.4,there is a convenient and gas-ecient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors.

**Recommendations:** 

Use custom errors to save deployment gas.



### Don't compare boolean expressions to boolean literals

**Description:** 

Comparing to a constant (true or false)is a bit more expensive than directly checking the returned boolean value.

**Recommendations:** 

Use `require(!paused,"Mint Paused!")`instead of `require(paused == false,"Mint Paused!")`.



### Floating pragma version should not be used

**Description:** The smart contracts are using a floating pragma range >=0.8.9 <0.9.0 

**Recommendations:** Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly.



### Incorrect cap returned

**Description:**

1. Observe the `cap`function

\```

function cap()public view returns(uint256){

return maxSupply;

}

\```

2. If `maxSupply`is 0 (no restriction)then cap returned will be 0 which is incorrect

**Recommendations:**

If `maxSupply`is 0 (infinite supply allowed)then return `type(uint256).max`.



### Sux check missing

**Description:** 

Observe that `setUriSux`is accepting empty `_uriSux`. 

**Recommendations:** Add a check on `setUriSux`

\```

require(bytes(\_uriSux).length != 0,""sux has empty uri"");

\```



### Incorrect comment

**Description:** 

The definition for `_uriSux`is mentioned incorrectly as `@param _uriSux The prefix string`

**Recommendations:** Change the comment as shown below:

`@param _uriSux The prefix string`

=> `@param _uriSux The sux string`.



### Unclear comment

**Description:** 

"prefix has emptry uri"does not make sense as an error message. If the intent is correctly understood,this should be saying that the uri prefix (function parameter)is empty.

**Recommendations:** 

"prefix has empty uri"should be replaced by "\_uriPrefix is empty". **Status:** Resolved 



### Redundancy in comment

**Description:** 

"NFTtoken"reads as "non fungible token token".

**Recommendations:** 

"The NFTtoken Id"can be replaced by "The token Id".



### Avoid code duplication

**Description:** 

The functions `mint`and `mintTo`have a similar name but use dierent permission logics. This might cause confusion and is not clearly documented in the code. The intent is not clear here.

**Recommendations:** 

If you want to allow either owner of address with minter role to mint,I recommend only using one function and adding both logics there. If both functions will be kept,either add clear comments or change the name of the functions.



### Avoid code duplication

**Description:** 

Both functions `mint`and `mintTo`are executing `\_mint`. The function naming does not make it easy to distinguish between both functions.

**Recommendations:** 

Remove function `mint`. If minting to `msg.sender`is intended then pass the `to`agrument as the address of `msg.sender`.



### Modifier written in CapWords style

**Description:** 

The modifier `MintedStarted`is written in CapWords style instead of mixedCase.

**Recommendations:** 

"It is suggested to use mixedCase when naming a modifier e.g. `mintedStarted`.
