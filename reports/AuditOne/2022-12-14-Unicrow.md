# Findings

## High Risk

### Possibility for owner to withdraw user funds

**Description:**

1. User calls the pay function with input.currency as `address(0)`and msg.value as `0`and input.amount as `X`and seller as his another wallet address
2. Since msg.value is 0 so below check is skipped
3. Since input.currency is address(0)so no token transfer happens
4. Finally the input amount is stored in the newly created escrow. Remember we have not paid anything till now
5. Now he uses his other wallet address as Seller and calls the refund function.

6. Since escrow.amount is X,project believes to have received such funds and returns them 



### Buyer can withdraw funds intentionally via front-running with proposeArbitrator function

**Description:**

1. Escrow was created between Buyer and Seller without any arbitrator
2. Post challenge period,Buyer calls the proposeArbitrator and set some fees (with arbitrator as another address)and immediately calls release function so that escrow could be released to Seller and Arbitrator
3. Even though there was no arbitrator,arbitrator fee set in step2 will be deducted from seller share

**Recommendations:**

The proposeArbitrator function should not directly update arbitratorData.arbitratorFee variable. Arbitrator could have an additional field like proposedFee which could be updated in such cases and if both party agrees then only proposedFee should become arbitratorFee



### Reentrancy to UnicrowClaim can claim twice 

**Description:** 

In function `refund()`,it set `claimed = 1`after withdrawing to buyer. If currency is native token or ERC777 with hook,buyer can take control of the execution flow and call `UnicrowClaim.singleClaim()`function. Since `claimed`is not set and consensus are set to positive value,it will not revert and allow buyer to claim the same escrow again.

The refund()is used to pay full funds to the buyer by the seller. The singleClaim()is used to pay funds for the buyer,seller,etc ... Both refund()and singleClaim have some

implementation as follows.

1. The nonReentrant modifier to prevent a re-entrancy attack
2. The checking of escrow.claimed is 0 to prevent re-claim. However,malicious attackers can claim two times per escrow and all funds in the contract can be stolen.

Example- malicious buyer:Alice,malicious seller:Bob

1. Alice and Bob create an escrow and Alice pay 1ETH for their orders as input.amount. Their escrow doesn’t split for arbitrator and protocol.
2. Bob executes refund()to pay the 1ETH to Alice as a seller
3. Alice received 1ETH before the state of claimed changed yet

4. (4 not 1)Alice executes singleClaim()as soon as Alice receives ETH in the fallback function
5. (5 not 2)It is true that both refund and singleClaim has the nonReentrant modifier

but these functions are in dierent contract. Since both contract import “ReentrancyGuard” separately,the state into nonReentrant modifier doesn’t synchronize.

6. (6 not 3)Finally,Alice and Bob got 2 ETH from 1ETH. If we continue this attack,attackers can get all ETH in the contract. Also,if the token follows ERC777,this token will be stolen like ETH.

You can see more detail of cross contract reentrancy attack

**Recommendations:** 

Consider following check-eect-interaction pattern or adding nonReentrant to functions `setClaimed()`/ `sendEscrowShare()`

"Should change the state of claimed before sending tokens.In other words,you should follow the check-eect-interactions pattern [https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_eects_interactions.html](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html)

// Update the escrow as claimed in the storage and in the emitted event



### Any party can reject receiving funds to prevent escrow from settling/claiming

**Description:** 

Since the system adopts ""Push""pattern to handle funds transferring when settling, if any transfer is failed then the escrow cannot be settled. Any party (buyer,seller,marketplace) can abused this,reject receiving funds (native token or ERC777)and prevent escrow from settling.

1. There was a dispute on escrow for which arbitrator was deciding the split
2. Arbitrator makes below split -> Buyer 80%,Seller 10%,Others 10%
3. Seller is unhappy with Arbitrator decision
4. Once Arbitrator initiates the claim based on his decided split,sendEscrowShare function is called to send each party share
5. Once sendEscrowShare function tries to send split to Seller (who is contract),Seller simply reverts the payment causing success to be false and whole claim to fail

**Recommendations:** 

Consider following Pull over Push pattern when dealing with settling escrow. Do not fail the claim function if party is trying to dos the receive payment. You may store these funds amount in a mapping variable and users can use another function to extract the failed payment using this mapping

**Status:** Resolved



### Rounding issue can lead to lacking funds in the contract

**Description:** 

In case `arbitrated = True`,arbitratorFee will be deducted from both buyer and seller splits. However they did not be sum up but after all,in `calculatePayment()`,arbitratorFee is calculated again with total amount.

Scenario (for simplicity,let's just assume there is only arbitrator fee)

1. arbitratorFee = 1000 (10%),split[Buyer]= 4999,split[seller]= 5001

arbitratorFeeFromBuyer = 4999 \*10%= 499,arbitratorFeeFromSeller = 500

sum = 999 != 1000 ??

2. After take fee split[Buyer]= 4500,split[seller]= 4501
3. Total splits = split[Buyer]+ split[seller]+ arbitratorFee = 10001> 10000

**Recommendations:** 

Consider returning arbitrator with the remaining amount without calculating it using `arbitratorFee`



### Division before multiplication can cause round down issue. Almost in all the places,it is happening

**Description:** 

Computation is done such that the division first and then multiplication. 

**Recommendations:** 

Perform multiplication first and then do divide.

**Status:** Resolved 



### splitCalculation - seller can get unfair amount of share when underflow happen

**Description:** 

Seller share is calculated inside unchecked state,when underflow happen,seller will receive huge share.

**Recommendations:**

Suggested not use unchecked based share calculation. Enusre,seller received within 100%split

**Status:** Resolved



## Medium Risk

### Rounding down caused leftover funds in the contract

**Description:** 

In `claimPayment()`,all payments to parties are calculated with rouding down division. It could potentially have some token weis leftover after `claimPayment()`. 

**Recommendations:** 

Consider returning the last payments the remaining amount without calculating it using rounding division.



### Unsupported for transfer-with-fee token

**Description:** 

Some ERC20 tokens(e.g. STA,PAXG,in the futureUSDC,USDT),allow for charging a fee any time transfer()or transferFrom()is called.

For more detail,please read this.

<https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer>

Assume that XYZ token is a fee-on-transfer token with a 10%transfer fee. Assume that the user sent 100 XYZ tokens. The accounting system set the amount to 100 but then actual amount of XYZ tokens received by the vault will only be 90 XYZ tokens.

**Recommendations:**

 Ensure that to check previous balance/after balance equals to amount for any rebasing/inflation/deflation. Or creating the whitelist to restrict can be used of ERC20 tokens in this protocol.



### Fee could be zero for small decimal tokens

**Description:** 

The fee is calculated as follows payments

It is possible for the calculated fee to be zero for some tokens with small decimals,such as EURS (2 decimals). Therefore,for small-volume transactions,tokens to be paid for protocol or marketplace may be rounded down to zero and stuck in the contract.

Finally,the amount of 50\*180 EURS will be stuck in this contract

**Recommendations:** 

Such cases are unlikely to occur. However,the possibility of it happening is not zero,so here is a token that can be restricted by the whitelist.

Alternatively,scale the amount to precision (1e4)amounts.

### arbitrator cannot be revoked

**Description:** 

There are no functions and way to revoke the arbitrator

**Recommendations:** 

Add function to revoke the arbitrator



## Low Risk

### Two Step Governance Change

**Description:**

1. Observe the updateGovernance function

2. Note that Governance is updated directly.
3. If old governance has provided incorrect address for new governance then governanceAddress is updated incorrectly

**Recommendations:**

Implement 2 step governance change,such that current governance can set a pending governance and then the new governance needs to accept in order to move from pending to confirmed state.



### Should change types of decimal to uint8

**Description:** 

The decimal of Token struct used uint256 but usually it is used the type of uint8 for the decimal

[https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ER C20.sol#L87-L89](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L87-L89)



### address (0)check

**Description:**

The updateGovernance is used to change the governanceAddress by governance address but if it is executed with address(0)mistakenly,this governance can’t change permanently. It is unlikely to happen but you should add this check to prevent such a mistake.



### Add immutable keyword

**Description:** The comment says to use immutable,but the implementation does not.

**Recommendations:** You should change to Unicrow public immutable unicorn;



### arbitrator should not be seller or buyer

**Description:** 

proposeArbitrator is called either by buyer or seller to fix the arbitrator. But it does not check whether the arbtrator is buyer or seller

**Recommendations:** 

Ensure that the arbitrator should not be either buyer or seller 



### Marketplace can be zero address but still having `marketplaceFee`makes it impossible to claim the escrow

**Description:** 

Lacking zero address check for `marketplace`address in function `pay()`. `marketplaceFee`can be non-zero value but `marketplace`is zero address. During claiming, transferring to zero address will fail and prevent escrow from claimed

**Recommendations:** 

Consider adding zero address check for `marketplace`in case `marketplaceFee > 0`



### Buyer can mistakenly send ETH to contract and ETH is locked

**Description:** 

In case `currency`is not ETH but buyer mistakenly send ETH in `pay()`function, transaction is not reverted. It still transfer ETH and currency token to the contract. Buyer cannot redeem or claim these ETH back.

**Recommendations:** 

Consider adding check for `currency`in case `msg.value > 0`



### No handling with msg.value but there is a payable keyword

**Description:**

Both singleClaim()and claim()has payable keyword but there is no handling of msg.value. This means that this function can receive ETH as a msg.value but this msg.value doesn’t use.

Finally,ETH sent to this function as msg.value will be stuck in this contract. Also,if the claim ()has a handling for msg.value,it has the risk of msg.value inside a loop [https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#msgvalue-inside-a-loop ](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#msgvalue-inside-a-loop)

**Recommendations:** 

Delete the payable keyword**.**



## Informational

### Nothing is allowed at escrow.challengePeriodEnd

**Description:**

You are not allowed to challenge at exact escrow.challengePeriodEnd. Also you are not allowed to release the payment at exact escrow.challengePeriodEnd (Note release function calls singleClaim function which have below check). So nothing can actually be done at exact escrow.challengePeriodEnd 

**Recommendations:** 

Update the challenge period till escrow.challengePeriodEnd



### Optimize number of external calls

**Description:** It is noticed that contracts (Unicrow,UnicrowClaim,UnicrowDispute,...)communicate, call each other frequently. Even some view function are called again and again. It is really gas consuming and not recommended.

For example,in `onlyEscrowMember`modifier,it does 2 external call to the same function `unicrow.getEscrow()`while it can be optimized easily with only 1external call 

**Recommendations:** Consider reviewing the external calls again and optimizing the gas cost for users.



### Caching number of storage load to save gas

**Description:** 

Accessing variable from memory/stack is much cheaper than from storage,it is recommended to cache the value loaded from storage when it is used multiple times.

For example,in function `approveSettlement()`,`latestSettlementOerBy[escrowId]`is loaded from storage 2 times

**Recommendations:** 

Consider caching the value loaded from storage to save gas



### Use fixed value not array.length

**Description:** The length of amounts is always 5 but the length is fetched by each loop

**Recommendations:** Update the function 



### Use external instead of public

**Description:**

The visibility of getSettlementDetails is public but this function doesn’t call in the UnicrowDispute contract. Therefore,this visibility should change from public to external in terms of gas-optimization

You can see for more details : [https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/19380/external-vs-public-best-practices ](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/19380/external-vs-public-best-practices)

**Recommendations:** Update the function



### Usage of post increment is not encouraged

**Description:** 

using post increment in loops could cause more gas

**Recommendations:** 

Use pre-increment
