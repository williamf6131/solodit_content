| Augur Core v2 Audit: Components | | Augur is a trustless, decentralized oracle and platform for prediction markets. The outcomes of Augur’s prediction markets are chosen by users that hold Augur’s native Reputation token, who stake their tokens on the actual observed outcome and, in return, receive settlement fees from the markets. Augur’s incentive structure is designed to ensure that honest, accurate reporting of outcomes is always the most profitable option for Reputation token holders. Token holders can post progressively-larger Reputation bonds to dispute proposed market outcomes. If the size of these bonds reaches a certain threshold, Reputation splits into multiple versions, one for each possible outcome of the disputed market; token holders must then exchange their Reputation tokens for one of these versions. Versions of Reputation which do not correspond to the real-world outcome will become worthless, as no one will participate in prediction markets unless they are confident that the markets will resolve correctly. Therefore, token holders will select the only version of Reputation which they know will continue to have value: the version that corresponds to reality. |

UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. For information about Outcome, a DAO tooling platform built on UMA that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens and optimistic governance. Users of the UMA system can enter into financial contracts that distribute funds according to the future price of an asset. Whenever the contract requires the asset price at a given timestamp (for instance, to ensure both parties are still correctly collateralized or to close a disputed contract at expiration), it will send a price request to the UMA oracle. All financial contracts pay a fee to use the oracle. The UMA oracle layers economic incentives over decentralized data aggregation in order to achieve consensus on the price. Price requests are batched in sequential rounds. In each round, the price of all outstanding requests are voted on using a commit-reveal scheme. In order to participate, voters must obtain UMA voting tokens (an ERC20), and their vote is weighted by their balance. If a minimum threshold of voters (by token count) is reached and more than half of them vote for the same value, this value is the resolution of the price request. If neither condition is met, the price remains unresolved until the next round, where it is voted on again. All successful voters are rewarded, per price request, with freshly minted tokens in proportion to their stake. Non-voters or incorrect voters are implicitly punished through inflation of the token supply. |
| Lien Protocol | | The Lien Protocol is the smart contract that enables the bifurcation, or the tranching, of ETH into two components; the variable component and the stable component. The variable component is the Liquid Bond Token (LBT) and the stable component is the Stable Bond Token (SBT). The LBT is designed to absorb most of the volatility, or the risk of the fluctuation in the ETH:USD price. This characteristic of the LBT makes it a supercharged financial instrument that performs essentially like a 2x leveraged call option on ETH. Because LBT strips away most of the price volatility, the SBT is stabilized against the US dollar. This characteristic of the SBT makes it a perfect collateral for the stable coin, iDOL. |
| MCDEX Mai Protocol V2 | | The mcdex.io Mai Protocol V2 aims to create decentralized Perpetual contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can either trade with the on-chain automated market maker (AMM) or the off-chain order book (Exchange). The system accepts ETH or any ERC20 compliant token (with at max. 18 decimals) as collateral. |
| Balancer Finance | | A Balancer Pool is an automated market maker with certain key properties that cause it to function as a selfbalancing weighted portfolio and price sensor. Balancer turns the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Balancer is based on a particular N-dimensional surface which denes a cost function for the exchange of any pair of tokens held in a Balancer Pool. |
| UMA Audit – Phase 2 | | UMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. UMA’s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets. UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. For information about Outcome, a DAO tooling platform built on UMA that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens and optimistic governance. Users of the UMA system can deploy new financial contracts that issue synthetic ERC20 tokens that derive value from an external asset. In the audited template, there are whitelists for the supported underlying asset pairs, expiry dates and acceptable ERC20 collateral tokens. Any user can choose a combination of these values to deploy a new financial contract. Subsequently, anyone can take an over-collateralized loan of freshly minted synthetic tokens that will be redeemable for the value of the specified asset at the expiry date, paid in the collateral currency. At expiry, the loan can be repaid with synthetic tokens or by withholding some of the collateral. The synthetic tokens themselves can be freely traded. One novel, and fundamental, feature of this system is the ability to encourage borrowers to maintain sufficient collateralization without on-chain access to a live price feed. This is achieved by limiting the amount of collateral that can be immediately withdrawn from a position and rewarding liquidators who find and challenge under-collateralized loans. If the liquidation itself is disputed, the price will be retrieved from the UMA oracle to resolve the dispute. |
| Bancor V2 AMM Security Audit | | Bancor V2 seeks to eliminate the risk of impermanent loss by allowing users to provide liquidity with up to 100% exposure to a single ERC20 token. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting the relative weights of the reserves based on an external Oracle. With every “rebalancing”, the weights are adjusted such that the pool represents the external price ratio between the token in the primary reserve (which contains an arbitrary ERC20 token, referred to as XYZ in technical documentation) and the token in the secondary reserve (usually BNT). |
| Shell Protocol | | Shell Protocol is a conjunction of a liquidity pool and AMM for stablecoins that is designed to have no slippage beyond the liquidity fee and to pass arbitrage profits on to the liquidity providers (LPs, from now on). To achieve this goal, Shell Protocol implements a bonding surface in its core logic made up of several smaller, locally-defined bonding surfaces. |
| Amp | | Amp is a universal collateral token designed to facilitate fast and efficient transfers for any real-world application. ‌When using Amp as collateral, transfers of value are guaranteed and can settle instantly. While the underlying asset reaches final settlement, a process that can take anywhere from seconds to days, Amp is held in escrow by a collateral manager. Once the transaction successfully settles, the Amp collateral is released and made available to collateralize another transfer. Amp exists to serve as universal collateral for anyone and any project. |
| Codefi ERC1400 Assessment | | Blockchain technology and more specifically the emergence of ""programmable"" tokens have opened a world of new possibilities for financial assets: the creation of digital assets. Digital assets are financial assets, which have been ""tokenized"". This means each asset is represented by a token on the blockchain.<br>Those tokens can be represented by multiple standards:<br>- ERC20 is the most basic and most adopted token standard. It can be seen as the ""axiom of token standards"" and is compatible with the majority of existing tools and platforms.<br>- ERC1400 is a more evolved standard, also ERC20-compliant, precisely designed for the use case of tokenized financial assets, allowing to perform highly controllable token transfers.<br>Codefi Assets is an advanced institutional technology platform for issuance and management of tokenized financial assets, powered by the Ethereum blockchain. |
| MCDEX Mai Protocol Audit | | Monte Carlo Decentralized Exchange is a decentralized derivatives exchange. Mai Protocol V2 is a system that allows users to trade trust-minimized Perpetual Futures contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can either trade with each other or trade against the Automated Market Maker smart contract. In this audit, we reviewed the smart contracts within this system. |
| mStable 1.1 | | mStable is a protocol for creating “meta assets” (mAssets) that are backed by baskets of tokenized assets of the same peg, such as stablecoins or commodities (referred to as “bAssets”). mAssets are always backed 1:1. bAssets supplied by users are automatically deposited into lending platforms (currently Aave and Compound). mAsset holders who stake in mStable’s SAVE contract earn 100% of the yield from lending platforms plus fees generated by users swapping between bAssets in the basket. |
| Compound Open Price Feed – Uniswap Integration Audit | | The Open Oracle is a standard and SDK allowing reporters to sign key-value pairs (e.g. a price feed) that interested users can post to the blockchain. The system has a built-in view system that allows clients to easily share data and build aggregates (e.g. the median price from several sources). |
| Aave Governance Dao | | Aave Governance V2 is an exciting new evolution of on-chain governance, allowing unique features, rapid protocol upgrades via short time lock executors, and governance upgrades via long time lock executors. This ensures the protocol can rapidly adjust to changing market conditions, as well as upgrade core parts of the protocol as time goes on. |
| Metaswap | | MetaSwap is a protocol that leverages metatransactions to enable instant, 'economically-trustless', 'gassless' swaps between multiple assets, EVM chains, and Lightning invoices. |
| ACO Protocol Audit | | ACO is a decentralized options protocol created by Auctus. Users can mint call and put options for different markets at different strike prices, and sell tokens which represent those options to other users. Options can be minted by sending a pre-determined collateral asset, such as ETH or USDC, to the ACOToken contract. Option minters can then offer their options (which themselves are ERC20 tokens) for sale to others. If options are sold, they allow the buyer the choice to exercise the option any time before the designated expiration date of the option token. Upon exercise, the exercising account burns their option tokens and purchases the collateral asset locked by the option minter at the designated strike price. The proceeds of this sale are transferred to the original option minter. Since the options are ERC20 tokens and are completely fungible, the exerciser may not receive collateral from the user that they purchased options from. Exercisers have the option to receive collateral from either a queue of option minters, or from a list of chosen accounts. If options are not exercised before the expiration date, the option token becomes worthless, and can no longer be exercised. Option minters can then redeem their accounts, receiving back their locked collateral, and keeping any profits from the sale of their option tokens. All available option markets correspond to their own ERC20 token, with an unchangeable strike price and expiration date. |
| Balancer Contracts Audit | | A Balancer Pool is an automated market maker with certain key properties that cause it to function as a selfbalancing weighted portfolio and price sensor. Balancer turns the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Balancer is based on a particular N-dimensional surface which denes a cost function for the exchange of any pair of tokens held in a Balancer Pool. |
| Primitive Audit | | Primitive is an options market platform that allows users to create new option types, to then mint, exercise, or close them during their entire life cycle. Because these options are fungible ERC20-compliant tokens, users can trade them in 3rd party exchanges to receive a premium. |
| Audius Contracts Audit | | Audius is a decentralized community of artists, developers, and listeners whose mission is to give everyone the freedom to share, monetize, and listen to any audio. The system comprises service providers who maintain the availability of the content, index the content for discovery, handle authentication, monitor activity, and cache. |
| Aave Protocol V2 | | Aave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an over-collateralised (perpetually) or under-collateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion. |
| Aave Safety Module | | The primary mechanism for securing the Aave Protocol is the incentivization of AAVE holders to lock tokens into a Smart Contract-based component called the Safety Module (SM). The locked AAVE will be used as a mitigation tool in case of a Shortfall Event within the money markets that belong to the Aave ecosystem. A Shortfall Event occurs when there is a deficit. The interpretation for the occurrence of a Shortfall Event is subject to the Protocol Governance vote, detailed in Governance. In the instance of a Shortfall Event, part of the locked AAVE are auctioned on the market to be sold against the assets needed to mitigate the occurred deficit. The SM includes a built-in backstop mechanism to prevent excess flow of AAVE into the open market that would further reduce the value of AAVE itself. Participants’ decision to lock AAVE into the SM assumes the acceptance of a potential Shortfall Event as they secure the protocol in return for receiving rewards, in the form of Safety Incentives (SI). To contribute to the safety of the protocol and receive incentives, AAVE holders will deposit their tokens into the SM. In return, they will receive a tokenized position that can be freely moved within the underlying network. The holder of the tokenized position can redeem their share from the SM at any time, triggering a cooldown period of one week (which can be further extended by the governance). SI rewards are subject to a cooldown period where tokens are unclaimable. The cooldown period is set to seven days. However, fees generated by the protocol are continuously allocated to the users participating in the SM and can be withdrawn. Fees generated from the protocol are redistributed to the SI participants. The reward plan for the SI is designed to incentivize participants contributing to the safety of the protocol in its early stages. The SI emission will be controlled by the governance and adjusted to the protocol's needs. All fees distributions mechanisms are only potential until they go through AIP process and governance vote. In case the SM is not able to cover all of the deficit incurred, the Protocol Governance can trigger an ad-hoc Recovery Issuance event. In such a scenario, new AAVE is issued and sold in an open auction for market price prioritizing the Backstop Module. The issuance of AAVE in case of a Shortfall Event is mitigated by the existence of the SM. Prior to any issuance, the deficit of the protocol is first covered by the SM reserves. |
| Set Protocol Audit | | Set Protocol provides a mechanism for a single ERC20 token to represent a combination of other tokens on Ethereum. The protocol is designed to be modular and extensible. To that end, each SetToken contract only contains core functions to change the distribution of external (component) ERC20 tokens that the set represents, and to mint and burn the aggregating Set tokens. Users must interact with module contracts that attach to Sets to define the logic of token issuance, redemption and Set modifications. Every set has a module that allows users to deposit the component tokens in exchange for Set tokens. Subsequently, Set token holders can redeem them in exchange for the underlying ERC20s that the tokens represent. In this audit, we reviewed this module as well as another module that allows a Set manager to collect a percentage of the Set value every block. In the future, new modules will be introduced to support trading and integration with exchanges. |
| Skale Network | | The SKALE Network is a high-throughput, low-latency, configurable byzantine fault tolerant, elastic blockchain network built interoperably with Ethereum. The initial and primary use case for this network will be in form of elastic sidechains for the Ethereum Blockchain. In this context it can be described as an ‘Elastic Sidechain Network’. |
| Endaoment Audit | | The Endaoment project is a Donor-Advised Funds platform, where everyone is free to transfer their ERC20 tokens to a Fund contract to fund approved organizations with the use of grants. More grants can be created for the same fund and when a specific grant is finalized an amount of donated tokens is transferred to the recipient organization. The funds received by an organization from the grant can be then cashed out. Anyone can propose claims containing basic information about an organization but an administrative governance choses which claims to approve, which organizations to allow and which grants can be finalized. The entire system is governed by owners of the EndaomentAdmin contract which stores and provides specific role accesses to users interacting with the system. They also manage two factories to deploy Org contracts, corresponding to allowed organizations, and Fund contracts. |
| MCDEX Mai Fund Protocol Audit | | Monte Carlo Decentralized Exchange is a decentralized derivatives exchange. The Mai Fund Protocol is a trading tool built on top of the Mai Protocol. It allows users to purchase shares in “funds”, which then trades perpetual futures on their behalf.

| Saddle Contracts Audit | | Saddle have created a Solidity implementation of Curve Finance’s StableSwap – which Curve wrote in Vyper. Designed to help combat the price instability that stablecoins face in DeFi, the whitepaper states that StableSwap is “a fully-autonomous market-maker for stablecoins with very minimal price slippage, as well as an efficient “fiat savings account” for liquidity providers on the other side”. |
| Notional Audit | | Notional is a protocol enabling fixed-term, fixed-rate lending and borrowing on the Ethereum blockchain through a novel financial primitive named fCash, which provides a mechanism for users to commit to transfers of value at a specific point in the future. fCash tokens can represent either a claim on a positive or negative cash flow, and are always generated in pairs of negative and positive tokens which always net to zero across the protocol. Positive fCash balances represent an amount of a specific currency type at a certain maturity, while negative fCash balances represent an obligation for the holder to provide an amount of a specific currency type at a certain maturity. |
| Fei Protocol | | Fei Protocol is the first protocol creating a stablecoin using a new stability mechanism called direct incentives. This stablecoin, named FEI, is not fully collateralized, but instead uses a system of incentives to encourage trading activity that brings the token back to its USD peg. This is achieved by attaching incentives to trades through an ETH/FEI Uniswap Pair, that mint or burn FEI tokens in certain situations. The protocol uses a bonding curve to price FEI, implements a Protocol Controlled Value to enable the incentive design, and has a governance token called TRIBE to allow user-controlled upgrades to the system |
| Futureswap V2 Audit | | Futureswap is a decentralized, non-custodial, leverage trading protocol where users can gain leveraged exposure on assets. Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit liquidity in order to earn passive income from trading fees and FST incentives. This liquidity is utilized by the Futureswap protocol and other automated market makers (AMMs) under the hood to create leveraged exposure. Realistically, Futureswap operates as a lending protocol as no leverage contracts are being created but only LPs lending funds while holding collateral. |
| 1inch Liquidity Protocol Audit | | Mooniswap is a constant-product AMM created by 1Inch that uses virtual balances to reduce liquidity providers’ losses to arbitrageurs. |

| UMA Audit – Phase 4 | | UMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. UMA’s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets. UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. For information about Outcome, a DAO tooling platform built on UMA that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens and optimistic governance. The system architecture is still correctly described by our previous audit reports. The main addition is the new Perpetual Multiparty template. This is very similar in purpose and function to the existing Expiring Multiparty template, except there is no expiration date. Instead, synthetic tokens can be issued, traded and redeemed indefinitely (unless the contract goes into emergency shutdown). This improves the generality and usefulness of the template but it introduces a complication. Without a final settlement procedure, the Perpetual Multiparty contracts need a different mechanism to ensure the price tracks the underlying asset. Conceptually, this is accomplished by continuous funding payments between sponsors and token holders to correct any price discrepancies. In practice, this is achieved by applying an incremental correction to the internal exchange rate between synthetic tokens and the underlying collateral for the purposes of liquidation, or settlement in the event of an emergency shutdown. The particular funding rate is based on an external price monitoring mechanism. Since the UMA Data Verification Mechanism (DVM) resolves too slowly to be used as a live price feed, the funding rate is introduced into the system through a new “optimistic” oracle. The optimistic oracle is a simple incentive scheme built on the recognition that as long as a price request is well specified and the UMA DVM is functioning correctly, the final resolution is predictable. Instead of waiting for the DVM to resolve, requesters can offer a reward for anyone to post the price immediately, along with a bond. Anyone else can dispute the price and match the bond. If no dispute occurs within a short time window, the optimistic oracle returns the proposed price. If there is a dispute, the oracle reverts to using the DVM, and both bonds are sent to the vindicated party. Although disputed prices require the full DVM mechanism to resolve, this won’t stall any updates to the Perpetual Multiparty template funding mechanism. This is because the contract does not require the external price at any particular timestamp, so it can simply ignore disputed requests until the oracle optimistically resolves with the price at a new timestamp. The reward, which is added to the system usage fees, is only paid to optimistically resolved requests. |
| Fei Protocol Audit | | Fei Protocol is the first protocol creating a stablecoin using a new stability mechanism called direct incentives. This stablecoin, named FEI, is not fully collateralized, but instead uses a system of incentives to encourage trading activity that brings the token back to its USD peg. This is achieved by attaching incentives to trades through an ETH/FEI Uniswap Pair, that mint or burn FEI tokens in certain situations. The protocol uses a bonding curve to price FEI, implements a Protocol Controlled Value to enable the incentive design, and has a governance token called TRIBE to allow user-controlled upgrades to the system |
| Celo Contracts Audit | | Celo is the carbon-negative, mobile-first, EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystem leading a thriving new digital economy for all. |
| Compound Governor Bravo Audit | | Governor Bravo is the governance module of the protocol; it allows addresses with more than 25,000 COMP to propose changes to the protocol. Addresses that held voting weight, at the start of the proposal, invoked through the getpriorvotes function, can submit their votes during a 3 day voting period. If a majority, and at least 400,000 votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after 2 days. |
| TEZOS FOUNDATION - OROPOCKET | | Tezos is an open-source platform for assets and applications that can evolve by upgrading itself. Stakeholders govern upgrades to the core protocol, including upgrades to the amendment process itself. |
| Moonwell Finance - Safety Module | | Moonwell’s primary mechanism for securing the protocol is the Safety Module – a smart contract that allows users to stake their assets in order to protect and mitigate against ""Shortfall Events"". A Shortfall Event occurs when there is a deficit in the markets of the Moonwell ecosystem. When this happens, the Safety Module is used to cover the losses by selling the assets needed to mitigate the deficit. Contributing to the Safety Module allows users to obtain additional incentives in return for a tokenized position which can be freely used in the protocol (for example: Governance). However, the original asset will always be at some form of risk if a Shortfall Event does occur. |
| BarnBridge Smart Yield Bonds Audit | | BarnBridge’s protocol of Smart Yield Bonds enables risk-averse ‘Senior Bond Holders’ to protect themselves against the risk of variable rate annuities, such as Compound, going down. A second group of participants referred to as ‘Juniors’ enable this by providing liquidity and taking on more risk. Purchasers of Senior Bonds are given a guaranteed return over a fixed period on their principal. Their principal is invested into a protocol with a variable rate of return – currently this is Compound. If a Senior’s principal deposit generates a larger return than their guaranteed return, the excess profit is given to the Juniors who bought the risk. Conversely, if the variable rate goes down, then the Juniors will take a loss to satisfy the Seniors’ guaranteed return. An Oracle determines a weighting of Compound’s interest in order to determine the guaranteed return a Senior should receive on a given deposit. |

| Holdefi Audit | | Holdefi is a lending platform where users can hold their assets and earn interest or borrow tokens and repay them after a specific period of time. Anyone can supply assets to Holdefi’s liquidity pool and immediately begin earning interest. |
| Empty Set V2 Audit | | In this iteration of the Empty Set protocol, we shift from novel mechanism design to usability. We aim to directly solve the need for a perfectly stable, yet censorship resistant asset that can be used as the basis for decentralized finance. The new version of the protocol introduces several differences from the previous one. The new protocol creates a stablecoin called ESD which relies on different mechanisms to stabilize the ESD price around 1 USDC. The new protocol consists in 3 new tokens: ESD, which is represented by the Dollar contract, ESDS, which is represented by the Stake contract, and sESD, implemented by the StabilizerToken. |
| Gitcoin Token Distribution | | Gitcoin (GTC) is an Ethereum token that enables community governance of the Gitcoin platform. The platform is designed to fund and coordinate open source development by novel means such as quadratic funding. As of June 2021, Gitcoin has facilitated over $21 million in grants and bounties for open source developers. |
| Rocketpool | | Rocket Pool is a first of its kind ETH Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had over 5 successful public betas over the life span of ETH development. Rocket Pool is designed to cater to two main user groups; those that wish to participate in tokenised staking using rETH (opens new window)using as little as 0.01 ETH and those that wish to stake ETH and run a node in the network to help generate a higher ROI than staking outside of the protocol due to commissions earned. For more information on these two groups that make up the protocol, we'd highly recommend reading article one in our explainer series (opens new window)that goes into great detail on how users can participate, be it via tokenised staking or running a node in the protocol. The core premise behind a protocol is to ensure the network is not beholden to any one party. This is a principle directly linked to Ethereum and ETH itself, and a mindset used at every stage of the process as Rocket Pool has evolved.

| SUSHISWAP - MISO | | Minimal Initial SushiSwap Offering, also known as MISO, is a set of open source smart contracts designed to simplify the process of launching new projects on the SushiSwap exchange. MISO aims to promote new capital and transactions on the exchange by increasing the attractiveness of SushiSwap as a place for token creators and communities to initiate new project tokens. In addition, MISO aims to create a launchpad for creators of technical and non-technical projects so that the community and projects can access all the options they need to safely and successfully deploy to the SushiSwap exchange. With this in mind, the development of MISO has led to the addition of some features that were not outlined in the original proposal. Similar to other exchanges in the cryptocurrency market, SushiSwap needs a launchpad that matches its user base and the items it wants to offer. MISO will be used as the personal platform for the SushiSwap community to start the project, so that the project and the community know that all aspects of the start-up are handled through a trusted open source contract. |

| MonoX | | MonoX is a new DeFi protocol using a single token design for liquidity pools (instead of using pool pairs). This is made possible by grouping deposited tokens into a virtual pair with the vUSD stablecoin. |
| Jarvis - AerariumMilitare | | |
| CENTAURSWAP | | Centaur Swap uses single-side staking to provide liquidity. In single-side staking, a liquidity provider only needs to stake a single asset rather than in the pair-based format that is seen on popular AMMs, where an LP needs to stake a pair of tokens in equal value to provide liquidity to a pool. Centaur Swap is designed to allow individual asset pools to trade with each other to maximise liquidity utilisation. This means that once an asset pool is funded, it can effectively be paired against every other existing asset pool. |
| 88mph | | 88mph is a DeFi protocol for providing fixed-term fixed-rate interest. It does so by pooling deposits with differing maturations and fixed-rates together and putting the funds in a yield-generating protocol, such as Compound, Aave, and yEarn, to earn floating-rate interest. The debt incurred by the promised fixed-rate interest of a deposit is offered as floating-rate bonds (or fundings as referred to in the contracts), which someone can purchase in exchange for the floating-rate interest generated by the corresponding deposit. Buyers of floating-rate bonds thus speculate on the floating-rate yield generated by the underlying protocol, while decreasing the debt of the pool and the risk of insolvency. |

| Rario | | |
| Boot Finance | | Boot Finance is a project focused AMM that aims to let projects control their own liquidity, with the eventual goal of being the primary AMM/DEX for the majority of projects in DeFi. As the majority of DeFi infrastructure moves to L2s over the coming months/years, the existing DEX/AMM ecosystem will be disrupted. It’s the thesis of Boot Finance that the current AMM dex landscape with one-size fits all solutions cannot persist as projects move to L2s. As gas costs reduce, there is reduced need for massive single source liquidity pools(the main competitive metric right now in DEXes), as arb bots can inexpensively arb the price across multiple liquidity sources. Many projects will want both the advantages of custom AMMs that provide features/parameters that are governed by the project itself, along with the ability to manage their LP positions in traditional DEXes across the entire EVM L2 landscape. Boot Finance introduces the novel CustomSwap algorithm that allows projects to more granularly control their price movements, and avoid sudden liquidity shocks. |
| Notional Governance Contracts v2 Audit | | Notional is a protocol enabling fixed-term, fixed-rate lending, and borrowing on the Ethereum blockchain through a novel financial primitive named fCash, which provides a mechanism for users to commit to transfers of value at a specific point in the future. The governance contracts specify an ERC20 token (i.e., NOTE) which is used for proposing upgrades and voting proposals. Votes represented by NOTE owners can be delegated to another address. Proposals have a minimum voting period and follow a timelock delay before being executed. Votes can be proposed by anyone with enough delegated NOTE tokens, and proposers must retain their NOTE balance until successful proposals are executed. A proposal in a non-executed state (include Succeeded and Queued) can be canceled by the guardian for any reason, or by any address if the proposer no longer has a sufficient delegated NOTE token balance. There is another mechanism implemented by the Reservoir contract that can be funded by the governance and used to continually drip some token to a target until the reservoir balance is depleted. The contract contains immutable variables which are set in its constructor function. These may be deployed by governance at a later date. |

| Biconomy - GasTank | | Gas Tank enables dApp owners to fill in gas into their dApp's gas tank. This offers a systematic approach for dApps to monitor how much gas fee their users are consuming and can fill in their gas tanks accordingly. DApp owners have the option to deposit native tokens in their dApp's gas tank via the biconomy dashboard or directly via the smart contract's write function. Each dApp is assigned a funding key that is visible on the dashboard. The funding key acts as a unique identifier that is used to identify the dApp gas tank. There is a minimum deposit amount that depends on the network on which the dApp is registered (For example: the minimum deposit amount on Polygon is 1 MATIC). Every dApp has an associated threshold value which is the estimated gas left in the tank that would allow the gas tank to last for 7 days. Based on this threshold there are 3 states of a gas tank: |

| UMA Audit – L2 Bridges | | UMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. UMA’s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets. UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. For information about Outcome, a DAO tooling platform built on UMA that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens and optimistic governance. The supported layer 2 (L2) chains, Optimism and Arbitrum, provide a mechanism to transfer funds to the Ethereum mainnet (L1). However, for security reasons, there is a significant delay before those transfers are finalized. To address this, L2 token holders can deposit funds in an UMA contract, the Deposit Box, knowing the tokens will eventually be transferred (as a batch) to an L1 UMA contract, the Bridge Pool. There is a separate Bridge Pool for each token to be transferred. Following an L2 deposit, anyone can relay the details to the L1 Bridge Pool, which waits a short period in case someone wants to dispute the relayed information. All disputes are handled by the Skinny Optimistic Oracle (described below). Before accepting the relay, liquidity providers must pre-fund the Bridge Pool contract in exchange for LP tokens. Undisputed relays are assumed valid, and the Bridge Pool completes the transfer using its own reserves, where a fraction of the transfer is diverted to the relayer and a fraction is retained as liquidity fees. The funds will eventually be replenished when the L2 deposit is finalized, and the liquidity fees are assigned to the LP token holders. The Bridge Pool also allows anyone to individually fund a transfer (without the Bridge Pool reserves) before the dispute period expires, in exchange for a fraction of the transfer amount. Since the relay can still be disputed, these funds would be lost if the relay was deemed to be incorrect. It is expected that in most cases, this mechanism will allow users to experience immediate L2-to-L1 token transfers. The Skinny Optimistic Oracle is conceptually very similar to the existing Optimistic Oracle. It provides an incentive mechanism for users to simply assert the result of an oracle request, which is assumed to be accurate if it is not disputed. Disputes are relegated to the slower DVM mechanism described in our previous audit reports. The main difference is that the new version requires users to provide all relevant information when executing function calls, so the values do not need to be saved or retrieved from storage. It also removes the ability for requesters to change configuration parameters in active requests. |

Blockswap's protocols introduce the new standard of tooling to build multichain and yield capturing protocols. |
| Kuiper | | The protocol is an asset management protocol that bundles ERC20 tokens into baskets and mints an ERC20 token representing the basket. Each basket has a publisher who can propose basket weights and composition, a license streaming fee on the basket, as well as update the publisher of that basket, all of these actions are subject to a 24 hour timelock. Baskets are created through the Factory contract which also creates an Auction contract for each basket. When a new weighting proposal for a basket passes the timelock, a rebalancing auction is started where anyone can bond a portion of the basket token supply and settle the auction by rebalancing the basket. The amounts needed to rebalance the basket are determined by the new weights as well as how long it takes for the auction to become settled. If an auction has not been settled after being bonded within 24 hours, the bond can be burned and the auction will need to be started again. Bounties can also be added to the auction that are claimed by the auction settler to incentive rebalances. Streaming fees for a basket are split between the publisher as well as the protocol owner if the protocol fee is turned on. They are calculated and handled on each mint or burn of the basket. The protocol owner fee split must be less than 20% of the basket's license fee. The protocol owner can change auction parameters, such as the auction multiplier, the min amount needed to bond, how much the auction decrements, as well as settings related to the protocol fee (fee split and receiving address). In general for this audit scope we consider the owner to be a trusted entity. Basket Tokens are standardized to 18 decimals. Token weights are defined as the amount of that token in one basket token, multiplied by the current iBRation (Index to Basket Ratio). The protocol is designed for standard ERC20 tokens, it is not currently concerned with the potential effects of rebasing or non-standard ERC20 implementations such as tokens that take a fee on transfers. It is assumed that publishers/users will check which tokens are added to baskets. |
| Perennial | | Perennial is a new cash-settled perpetual synthetics protocol. It allows developers to launch any synthetic market with just a few lines of code. Perennial creates two-party markets where takers receive exposure to a defined payoff, while makers take the opposing side of the trade while also providing liquidity. P&L is determined directly via oracle price with zero slippage, with settlement lag introduced to counter game-ability. Maker-taker utilization is balanced using a floating funding rate. |
| Amun | | The amun basket protocol is an index token and the supporting contracts needed for interacting with it. The core contract is the Basket build from facets with the diamond standard. The Basket has facets adding ERC20, basket, and callManager functionality. Basket facet enables join/exiting the basket and removing/adding underlying. The CallManager facet enables manager to acct as the Basket. This allows RebalanceManager to rebalance the underlying. This contract can only be used by the owner and trades underlying via exchanges like uniswap. The SingleJoin and SingleExit are helper contracts that enable buying/selling the underlying token from a single token like WETH. The Bridge token are a pair of token enabling bridging the basket between ethereum and matic. This is done by deploying on ethereum and matic according to the Polygon PoS token standard. |
| Yeti Finance | | Yeti Finance is a decentralized borrowing protocol with a stablecoin built on Avalanche. Think of it as Liquity + Abracadabra on steriods. Yeti Finance lets users borrow against their staked assets, LP tokens, and other interest-bearing and base-level assets with zero acccruing interest fees. Yeti Finance allows users to borrow against their entire portfolio at once, reducing the risk that one asset flash crashing would result in liquidation. After depositing their collateral in a smart contract and creating an individual position called a ""trove"", the user can get instant liquidity by minting YUSD, a USD-pegged stablecoin. Each trove is required to be collateralized at a minimum of 110%. Any owner of YUSD can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying collateral at any time. The redemption mechanism along with algorithmically adjusted fees guarantee a minimum stablecoin value of USD 1. A liquidation mechanism based on incentivized stability deposits and a redistribution cycle from riskier to safer troves provides stability at a much lower collateral ratio than is typical in the current crypto lending landscape. Stability is maintained via economically-driven user interactions and arbitrage, rather than by active governance or monetary interventions. |
| 1inch Limit Order Protocol Audit | | 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts, that can work on any EVM based blockchains (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche).

They can then be further subdivided arbitrarily, and streamed in real time to anything you want, trustlessly, leveraging the composability of smart contracts. |
| Uma Audit – Phase 6 | | UMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. UMA’s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets. UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. For information about Outcome, a DAO tooling platform built on UMA that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens and optimistic governance. The current Governance contract allows the Risk Labs Foundation to propose new governance actions that can be ratified by the UMA token holders. The new Proposer contract is intended to take the proposer role, allowing anyone to make new proposals as long as they provide a bond that will be sacrificed if the proposal fails. There is no specific incentive for making proposals. The intention is to ensure that only the actions which are very likely to be accepted will be proposed. The new cross-chain mechanism allows governance proposal to be passed from the Ethereum mainnet to the Optimism and Arbitrum chains. In this way, the UMA governance mechanism on layer 1 can be used to govern UMA contracts on the supported layer 2 chains. The mechanism also allows price requests and resolutions to be forwarded between the layers, so Optimistic Oracles on the layer 2 chains can be secured by the mainnet Data Verification Mechanism in the same way that the layer 1 Optimistic Oracle is secured by the DVM. It is worth noting that these messages are sent using the native bridge mechanics, which means they are limited by the characteristics of the relevant layer 2 chains. In particular, the messages from layer 2 to layer 1 could take a week or longer to transit the bridge. Moreover, the UMA governance mechanism supports proposals that include multiple ordered transactions, but this merely restricts the order in which they can be added to the bridge. It’s possible for some of those transactions to be executed in a different order, or not at all, on layer 2. The Optimistic Rewarder contract simply mints ERC721 tokens for anyone who requests them. It also allows anyone to associate arbitrary data with any token, and to deposit various ERC20 tokens to be distributed as rewards. The interpretation of the arbitrary data and the expected distribution of rewards amongst the token holders are determined using an unspecified off-chain procedure. Anyone can make a claim that a specific ERC721 token is owed a set of rewards if they’re willing to deposit a bond. The standard Optimistic Oracle mechanism is used to allow someone else to dispute the claim, which will be resolved by the DVM. Claims that are not disputed in time are assumed to be valid, and the contract distributes the rewards accordingly. The only restriction (to simplify accounting) is that the oracle bond token cannot be used as a reward token. Lastly, PR3611 modifies the insured bridge mechanism to avoid sending WETH across the Optimism token bridge, which is not supported. Instead, any L2 WETH deposited in the Optimism deposit box is unwrapped to L2 ETH before transiting the bridge. On layer 1, the ETH is converted to WETH before being forwarded to the WETH bridge pool. |

| Anchor | | Anchor is a decentralized savings protocol offering low-volatile yields on Terra stablecoin deposits. The Anchor rate is powered by a diversified stream of staking rewards from major proof-of-stake blockchains, and therefore can be expected to be much more stable than money market interest rates. The Anchor community believes that a stable, reliable source of yield in Anchor has the opportunity to become the reference interest rate in crypto. The Anchor protocol defines a money market between a lender, looking to earn stable yields on their stablecoins, and a borrower, looking to borrow stablecoins on stakeable assets. To borrow stablecoins, the borrower locks up Bonded Assets (bAssets) as collateral, and borrows stablecoins below the protocol-defined borrowing ratio. The diversified stream of staking rewards accruing to the global pool of collateral then gets converted to stablecoin, and then conferred to the lender in the form of a stable yield. Deposited stablecoins are represented by Anchor Terra (aTerra). aTerra tokens are redeemable for the initial deposit along with accrued interest, allowing interest collection to be done just by holding on to them. Anchor is structured to provide depositors with: <br>*High, stable deposit yields powered by rewards of bAsset collaterals<br>*Instant withdrawals through pooled lending of stablecoin deposits<br>*Principal protection via liquidation of loans in risk of undercollateralization<br>Anchor is an open, permissionless savings protocol, meaning that any third-party application is free to connect and earn interest without restrictions. Through Anchor Earn, Anchor.js or EthAnchor, developers can interact with Anchor using just a few lines of code. Further documentation of the Anchor Protocol is provided in the following pages. |

| Rolla | | The Quant Protocol is a decentralized options protocol allowing anyone to mint and trade 100% collateralized, cash-settled European options. The Quant protocol tokenizes options using the ERC20 standard and also tokenizes a receipt of mint known as a ""CollateralToken"" which uses the ERC1155 standard. Minting an option or spread requires the max loss of the option seller i.e. fully collateralized options. The Collateral Token entitles the option minter to reclaim any excess collateral once the option has expired. Options are settled using chainlink post-expiry. The settlement price submission is permissionless - anyone can call the function to settle an option and as long as chainlink has a valid price it'll settle. Rolla is a DeFi structured product platform built on the Quant Protocol that allows anyone to get risk-based yield on various cryptocurrencies or stablecoin. This is accomplished via selling out of the money European covered call and put options on the Quant Protocol. |

Looking into the future we want to become a go-to platform for metaverse content creation, and to see a lot of cross-pollination and remixing among the projects built with Joyn. We fully embrace modularity and interoperability with our architecture. We have modules that extend the ERC721 standards, which provide functionalities beyond minting and transferring token instances. Eg. NFT collections launched through Joyn out of the box allow project creators to split royalties among an arbitrary number of recipients, which means we could achieve shared royalties between everyone involved in the project. This paves the way for open co-creation of web3 content, where all contributors may share ownership and royalties, and benefit directly from the project’s success. With that as a foundation, this will also unlock content attribution / remixing as a new class of use case based on inter-referencing projects. |

Instead, the backing is optimized among denominations and venues in pursuit of the best rates. Doing this in a credibly neutral way at scale is the goal of market governance. VCON is the governance token, not yet live, which represents a share of the surplus buffer. Any losses taken by the protocol are absorbed first by the surplus buffer, and VCON auctions will be used to recapitalize when the buffer is too low. |
| Tribe DAO - Flywheel v2, xTRIBE, xERC4626 | | Flywheel is a suite of open source token incentives and governance infrastructure using modern and modular solidity patterns to easily interface with other platforms. It is built by the Tribe DAO using Foundry and Solmate. Flywheel is completely on-chain and composable, for maximum compatibility with smart contract systems. EIP-4626: The Tokenized Vault Standard is an ethereum application developer interface for building token vaults and strategies. It is meant to consolidate development efforts around ""single token strategies"" such as lending, yield aggregators, and single-sided staking. |
| Brokkr Protocol P3 Contracts CosmWasm | | Brokkr is an investment protocol that provides sustainable and predictable returns. This is achieved through automated portfolios, instruments that consist of several investment strategies that combine the usage of multiple dApps. |
| Backed Protocol | | Backed protocol enables peer-to-peer loans with NFT collateral. Its main unique features are<br>- No back and forth negotations: Borrowers propose minimum viable terms (loan asset, minimum loan amount, minimum duration, max interest rate) and the loan starts immediately once a lender meets or beats the minimum terms.<br>- No oracles: borrowers and lenders agree to loan terms and that's all that matters. The only ""liquidation"" type event is that lenders can seize the NFT collateral if the loan is past due.<br>- Composability: borrowers get Borrow Tickets and lenders get Lend Tickets. Control flows query for the current owner of these ticket, rather than a static borrower/lender address. For example, when a loan is repaid, the funds go to the Lend Ticket holder, whoever that happens to be at the moment of that transaction.<br>- Perpetual lender buyout: a lender can be boughtout at any time by a new lender who meets the existing terms and beats at least one term by at least 10%, e.g. 10% longer duration, 10% higher loan amount, 10% lower interest. The new lender pays the previous lender their principal + any interest owed. The loan duration restarts on buyout. |
| Duality Focus | | Duality Focus is a money market where both ERC-20 assets and Uniswap V3 liquidity positions are accepted as collateral. On Focus, users can engage in familiar DeFi operations like lending and borrowing ERC-20 assets. However, because we underwrite Uniswap V3 positions from selected pools, new usecases become possible. Users can supply their V3 ranges as additional collateral and get access to additional borrow power. Our flagship usecase is ""focus"": users can leverage ranges with supported ERC-20 assets, increasing fees earned. They can also move liquidity, move positions to different ticks, and compound fees, all with a single click. |
| Axelar Network | | Axelar is a decentralized interoperability network connecting all blockchains, assets and apps through a universal set of protocols and APIs. It is built on top off the Cosmos SDK. Users/Applications can use Axelar network to send tokens between any Cosmos and EVM chains. They can also send arbitrary messages between EVM chains. Axelar network's decentralized validators confirm events emitted on EVM chains (such as deposit confirmation and message send), and sign off on commands submitted (by automated services) to the gateway smart contracts (such as minting token, and approving message on the destination). |
| JPEG'd | | JPEG'd is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that enables non-fungible token (NFT) holders to open collateralized debt positions (CDPs) using their NFTs as collateral. Users mint PUSd, the native stablecoin of the protocol, enabling them to effectively obtain leverage on their NFTs. The protocol will be managed by a governance token, JPEG, that will oversee, administer, and change parameters of the protocol. JPEG'd is completely permissionless, decentralized, and is not controlled by any central entity. JPEG's aim is to bridge DeFi and NFTs and eventually allow any NFT collection, as voted upon by governance, to obtain a line of credit using their NFTs as collateral on the protocol. |

| THORSwap Aggregators | | THORswap is a multi-chain DEX aggregator built on THORChain's cross-chain liquidity protocol and the #1 interface for all THORChain services like THORNames and synthetic assets. THORswap currently supports cross-chain L1 swaps between 20+ crypto assets across 5+ blockchains in a decentralized and non-custodial manner. |
| Tracer | | TracerDAO introduces a derivative infrastructure called Perpetual Pools. Users create leveraged tokens, whereby long and short positions have changing claims on a pool of collateral. As long and short collateral tends to parity due to the implicit rebalancing rate, users' returns are expected to simulate a constantly rebalancing leveraged position. These positions cannot be liquidated, are fully collateralised, and can exist perpetually without upkeep. Several improvements and new features have been implemented in a second version (V2) of their contracts. |
| Phuture Finance | | Phuture is an asset management protocol initially focused on crypto index products. Our protocol provides the functionality to mint, redeem and create index products. We utilise a vault design to store the underlying assets of the index and these vaults can have additional ""controllers"" added to them to support extra functionality or strategies. At launch we have integrated a yearn vault controller that allows us to move some of the index funds over to yearn to earn additional interest. vTokens are created for each token held in a vault and allow us to account for assets which are held in our contracts plus the contracts of other protocols (such as yearn). Rebalancing of these indices is executed against the liquidity held on Uniswap v2 and Sushiswap. Our contracts create a set of orders for each index that will bring that index back to it's correct balance. These orders are then executed by our keeper. In most cases, orders are too large to execute in one go due to price impact, so our smart contracts scale the orders down to adhere to a specific price impact. Fees are taken during the minting and redemption process. In addition, we charge a fee annually for the management of the index products. The protocol's base curreency is USDC and as such the net asset value of each index is calculated in USDC. |

| Overlay | | Overlay is a novel protocol designed around trading assets without requiring a counterparty. This is done by staking OVL (the underlying protocol token) as a collateral, where the protocol mints/burns OVL tokens depending on whether the trade resulted in a profit or loss. To prevent inflation, markets have to be deployed by Overlay governance which tunes the parameters using off-chain risk models. There is also an on-chain component to the risk model which introduces extra checks to trades, oracle updates, etc. |
| Cally | | Cally lets you create covered call vaults on any ERC20 or ERC721 that perpetually sell call options on the asset that you deposit into the vault. |

| UMA Across V2 Audit | | UMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. UMA’s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets. UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. For information about Outcome, a DAO tooling platform built on UMA that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens and optimistic governance. The Across V2 system manages multiple contracts which hold funds and transfer them to each other. These are the HubPool and multiple SpokePools. The Spokes can exist on other chains, and thus there are standardized “adapters” for sending funds from the hub to the various spokes in order to have a predictable interface. The system allows users to make deposits on one chain, specifying a desire to withdraw on a different chain and paying a fee. At any point, other users can “fill” this “relay”, supplying the original depositor with funds on a different chain and taking a small fee. The relayers are then refunded by the system. If relayers do not fill deposits, the system performs a “slow relay” in which funds are moved across cross-chain bridges to fill the deposit. The system cannot easily pass messages across cross-chain bridges, so in order for the hub to understand the state of all spokes, and to transfer funds accordingly, merkle trees are produced representing the needed actions, such as rebalances and relayer refunds. These merkle trees are represented with their roots, where the full set of needed merkle roots is called the “root bundle”. These are optimistically validated – meaning that they are considered truthful if not disputed within a certain time window. Once the liveness period (in which other users can dispute a root bundle) passes, funds can be transferred between the hub and spokes by using merkle proofs to prove that the transfer was included in the root bundle. The rules by which a root bundle is determined invalid are notably NOT a part of the smart contract system, and are instead decided by an outside system called the Optimistic Oracle. These dispute rules are to be codified into an UMIP (UMA Improvement Proposal) or multiple UMIPs. Therefore, much of the security of the system rests on the un-audited UMIP, and for the sake of the audit we treated the UMIP as a black box. During the audit, we provided the UMA team with suggestions and reminders for important security considerations when it comes to codifying the UMIP(s). |
| Seascape - New Staking Saloon | | The third of Seascape’s modularized DeFi games has been totally revamped. Staking Saloon is a game in which users stake NFTs in exchange for token rewards. This guide will take users step by step through how the game works. The game will automatically recognize the Scapes in your crypto wallet. While other wallets are compatible with the system, we recommend using Metamask as it consistently gives the best performance. |
| Sturdy | | Sturdy is a protocol for interest-free borrowing and high yield lending. Lenders deposit stablecoins that they want to earn yield on while borrowers provide collateral and take out loans at no interest (interest rates will kick in above certain utilization rates, but this functionality is out of scope). Sturdy accomplishes this by staking collateral provided by borrowers in third party protocols like Yearn, Lido, and Convex. The yield from collateral staking is periodically harvested, swapped to stablecoins, and distributed to stablecoin lenders. Sturdy forked Aave V2 contracts for its underlying accounting and lending pool mechanics. In order to convert non-interest bearing tokens ('external assets', e.g. ETH) to their interest bearing equivalent ('internal assets', e.g. stETH), Sturdy uses modules called 'vaults.' When users deposit external assets to a vault, the vault immediately stakes it, converting it to an internal asset, and deposits it to the lending pool. When users want to withdraw their collateral, the vault withdraws the internal asset from the lending pool, unstakes it, and returns it to the user. The user can also deposit or withdraw internal assets directly from the lending pool by interacting directly with the smart contracts. |
| OpenSea | | Seaport is a marketplace protocol for safely and efficiently buying and selling NFTs. Each listing contains an arbitrary number of items that the offerer is willing to give (the ""offer"") along with an arbitrary number of items that must be received along with their respective receivers (the ""consideration""). |
| Bastion Protocol - EVM contracts | | Bastion is a Lending and Stableswap protocol built on Aurora, NEAR’s EVM-compatible layer. Building on Aurora enables Bastion to create an autonomous interest-rate engine with superior capital efficiency, low slippage swaps, fast transactions, ultra-low fees, precise liquidations, and harness the underlying UX benefits of NEAR. |
| Rubicon | | Rubicon(opens in a new tab) is an order book protocol for Ethereum(opens in a new tab). Use it to trade ERC-20(opens in a new tab) tokens with Swaps, Limit Orders, and Market Orders or provide liquidity in Pools. Rubicon is built on Optimism(opens in a new tab), a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum L2(opens in a new tab) chain. |
| Velodrome Finance | | A base layer AMM on Optimism, inspired by Solidly. |
| veToken Finance | | veToken Finance is an forked version of the convex yield protocol that targets all ve-model projects. The core of the veToken idea is the locking up of its native token and empowering voting rights, generating decentralized governance to maximize benefit. |
| Porter Finance | | Porter's mission is to enable DAOs growth by providing them with access to credit. Porter allows DAOs and other on-chain entities to create so-called ""DeFi bonds"". allowing borrowing capital when bonds are sold to lenders. The team is using smart contracts as agreements between borrowers and lenders similar to traditional zero coupon bonds, which can be sold at a discount on the market. Borrowers select param-eters when they create their bond including a pair of tokens representing collateral and payment. conversion ratio, maturity and the number of bonds. As a result, bonds (based on ERC20 tokens) are minted and sold on the market to bondholders (lenders). Initially the bond contract only holds collateral supplied by the borrower (e.g. DAO), but when maturity is reached or the bond is fully repaid using a payment token, bondholders can redeem their assets. The protocol does not implement any liquidation mechanisms and is purely based on the ratio between the collat-eral and payment tokens. meaning that it exposes lenders to market volatility. |
| Forta Protocol Audit | | Forta is a decentralized monitoring network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems in real-time. Underlying Forta is a decentralized network of independent node operators that scan all transactions and block-by-block state changes for outlier transactions and threats. When an issue is detected, node operators send alerts to subscribers of potential risks, which enables them to take action. |
| Infinity NFT Marketplace | | The Axie Infinity Marketplace is the NFT marketplace for a popular NFT/crypto based video game known as Axie Infinity. The marketplace lets users buy a variety of items such as creatures, items and land as NFTs. The marketplace is often a starting place for those looking to get into the game. |
| Lyra Finance | | Lyra is an option automated market maker (AMM) that allows traders to buy and sell options on cryptocurrencies against a pool of liquidity. The Lyra protocol has two key user groups, liquidity providers and options traders. Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit sUSD (a stablecoin) or USDC into one of the asset-specific Lyra Market Maker Vaults (MMVs). This liquidity is used to make two-sided (buy and sell) option markets for the asset that the vault specifies (e.g. ETH Market Maker Vault LPs quote options on ETH). LPs deposit liquidity to the vault to earn the fees paid when options are traded. Traders use Lyra to trade options. They can either buy options from or sell options to the MMV. Traders pay fees (in the form of the bid-ask spread) to LPs, as compensation for their liquidity. |

| Locke | | The Locke protocol is designed as a novel way to exchange one token for another. Any user willing to exchange a certain amount of tokens (called reward token in the protocol) for another token (called deposit token in the protocol) can create a stream that happens over a certain duration. The protocol was inspired by Time Weighted Automated Market Makers. Users willing to buy may stake deposit tokens, which get exchanged for the reward token in a mechanism that is similar to liquidity mining contracts. Contracts have a special case where the deposit tokens are not exchanged but locked up in the contract for a predefined duration of time. |
| Moonwell Finance - Token Sale & Comptroller Updates | | Moonwell is an open lending, borrowing, and decentralized finance protocol built on Moonbeam and Moonriver. Moonwell's composable design can accommodate a full range of DeFi applications in the greater Polkadot and Kusama (DotSama) ecosystem. |
| Timeless | | Timeless is a yield tokenization protocol that offers Perpetual Yield Tokens (PYTs), which give their holders a perpetual right to claim the yield generated by the underlying principal. Timeless also offers Negative Yield Tokens (NYTs), a protocol-native way to short yield rates. |
| Yieldy | | Yieldy is a protocol that creates a rebasing token for assets that have a Tokemak reactor. For each asset that Tokemak supports, we can create a Yieldy token for that asset. For instance, for USDC we will create USDCy, Fox will have a FOXy and so on. This allows for single sided staking with compounding interest through the use of depositing into Tokemak reactors. |
| Nibbl | | Nibbl is a fractionalization protocol that creates ERC20 tokens representing fractional ownership of an ERC721. Nibbl uses a Bonding curve to facilitate trading of the ERC20 tokens. The protocol also implements a valuation-based buyout mechanism so that the ERC721 isn’t locked in a contract/vault forever. A user can initiate a buyout and they need to pay an upfront cost for that. The cost is decided based on the current valuation of tokens. If the valuation goes above a certain level within a predefined duration the buyout is rejected. Therefore, the community can buy more tokens in order to reject a buyout. If the buyout isn’t rejected it is automatically considered successful and the user who initiated the buyout can withdraw the asset. |
| Aura Finance | | Aura Finance is a protocol built on top of the Balancer system to provide maximum incentives to Balancer liquidity providers and BAL stakers (into veBAL) through social aggregation of BAL deposits and Aura’s native token. The Convex system has been adapted to be generic. Aura is a fork of the well known Convex system. Naming conventions and architecture from the original Convex system have been kept in Curve, so those familiar with their system or repo will have an easier time parsing the functionality. |
| Putty | | An order-book based american options market for NFTs and ERC20s. |
| Origin Governance Audit | | The system enables users to participate in the governance of the Origin Protocol through staking their OGV tokens, allowing users to earn more OGV as a staking reward. The staking contract OgvStaking allows OGV governance tokens to be staked to obtain non-transferable ERC20Votes-based tokens called OGVe which can participate in a GovernorBravo-compatible governance vote. The minimum and maximum lockup periods are 7 and 1461 days, respectively. In addition, each staker earns OGV tokens at a pre-configured daily total rate set per time interval and emitted from the RewardsSource contract. The OGVe tokens are awarded based on a constant inflation factor of 80% per year in relation to the end of the staking lockup period. This mechanism is designed to limit the voting power of stakes which are no longer in lockup. |
| Notional Finance | | Notional is a protocol on Ethereum that facilitates fixed-rate, fixed-term crypto asset lending and borrowing through a novel financial instrument called fCash. |
| Beanstalk | | Beanstalk is an Ethereum-based permissionless and algorithmic fiat stablecoin protocol. It is used for issuance of BEAN stablecoin pegged at 1:1 ratio to the US Dollar.  Beanstalk is different from fiat and crypto-collateralized stablecoin protocols as it works based on a credit-based price stability model. The users of the Beanstalk protocol are constantly rewarded with economic incentives for issuing credit or providing liquidity to the protocol and thus maintaining BEAN’s price stability. |
| Juicebox | | The Juicebox protocol is a programmable treasury. Projects can use it to configure how its tokens should be minted when it receives funds, and under what conditions those funds can be distributed to preprogrammed addresses or reclaimed by its community. These rules can evolve over funding cycles, allowing people to bootstrap open-ended projects and add structure, constraints, extensions, and incentives over time as needed. The protocol is light enough for a group of friends, yet powerful enough for a global network of anons sharing thousands of ETH, ERC-20s, or other assets. |
| Staderlabs - BnbX | | BNBX is a reward-bearing liquid token i.e. the value of 1 BNBx token vs. BNB increases over time as staking rewards accumulate. |
| Fractional | | The Fractional v2 Protocol is designed around the concept of Hyperstructures<br>Hyperstructures: Crypto protocols that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption, or intermediaries<br>Fractional is a decentralized protocol that allows for shared ownership and governance of NFTs. When an NFT is fractionalized, the newly minted tokens function as normal ERC-1155 tokens which govern the non-custodial Vault containing the NFT(s). |
| ENS | | ENS is a decentralised naming service built on top of Ethereum, and designed to resolve a wide array of resources including blockchain addresses, decentralised content, and user profile information. |
| Compound III Audit | | Compound III is an EVM compatible protocol that enables supplying of crypto assets as collateral in order to borrow the base asset. Accounts can also earn interest by supplying the base asset to the protocol. |
| Across Token and Token Distributor Audit | | The Across token is an ERC20 compliant token. The Across token distributor allows users to stake whitelisted ERC20 tokens (LP tokens) to earn ACX rewards. At deposit time depositors earn a fixed base emission rate. The longer depositors keep their tokens staked, the higher the reward rate they earn. The reward rate is capped at a value set by the owner of the distributor. Sequential deposits result in an average deposit time as a weighted average of previous deposits. If at any point the depositor claims their rewards or unstakes all LP tokens, then their rewards emission rate is reset to the base rate. The contract is designed to hold multiple LP tokens, each with independent parameterization for liquidity mining. |
| UMA Optimistic Governor Audit | | UMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. UMA’s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets. UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. For information about Outcome, a DAO tooling platform built on UMA that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens and optimistic governance. The Optimistic Governor contract is meant to control an “avatar” that complies with the Gnosis’ Zodiac framework. The target use case is that the avatar is a Gnosis Safe that holds DAO funds and is capable of controlling DAO operations. The Optimistic Governor aims to allow anyone to control DAO funds and activities as long as their proposed activities conform to a set of natural language rules that the DAO has made publicly available. This is facilitated via the UMA Optimistic Oracle, which becomes the final arbiter in case proposals are contested for not conforming to DAO rules. In the case where proposals are not contested during their “liveness” period, they then become executable by anyone. The unrelated Optimistic Oracle PR we were asked to review adds a mechanism to suspend reentrancy guard protections to allow for callbacks in the body of nonRentrant functions (where such callbacks would not otherwise be permissable). Additionally, the Oracle was modified to support “event-based” price requests – that is price requests after some event in the future occurs, rather than at a specific point in time. |

| PartyDAO | | The Party Protocol allows people to pool funds together to acquire NFTs then govern those NFTs together. |
| Y2k Finance | | Y2K Finance is a protocol to insure(hedge) against pegged assets and speculate on depegs. The aim of this protocol is to allow users to HEDGE & RISK these insurances, also providing yield to incentivize early depositors on both side of insurance (buyers and sellers). We consider insurance sellers to be the same as Risk users, or collateral depositors. We also consider insurance buyers to be the same as Hedge users, or premium depositors. This is made possible by having Vaults that leverage ERC4626 and a Chainlink Oracle to determine the current price. When the price of a pegged asset is below the strike price of a Vault, a Keeper(could be anyone) will trigger the depeg event and both Vaults(hedge and risk) will swap their total assets with the other party. These insurances last a certain amount of time, and if a depeg event does not happen between that time period, a Keeper will trigger the end of epoch event, being that the Hedge Vault then has to give all of its total assets to the Risk Vault. It is issued a token representing the depositors position which is 1 to 1 ratio'ed to the deposited amount, and users can deposit that token in a fork of Synthetix Rewards to ""yield farm"" governance tokens. |

Drips can also send ETH value, which makes them ideal for keeping addresses sufficiently funded with ETH. Drippie is designed to be connected with smart contract automation services so that drips can be executed automatically. However, Drippie is specifically designed to be separated from these services so that trust assumptions are better compartmentalized. |

| The Graph | | The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, starting with Ethereum. It makes it possible to query data that is difficult to query directly. The Graph Network consists of Indexers, Curators and Delegators that provide services to the network, and serve data to Web3 applications. Consumers use the applications and consume the data. To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants stake and use Graph Tokens (GRT). GRT is a work token that is an ERC-20 on the Ethereum blockchain, used to allocate resources in the network. Active Indexers, Curators and Delegators can provide services and earn income from the network, proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake. To reduce gas costs and sustainably scale The Graph Network, there are active proposals to move the contracts to the Arbitrum Layer 2 blockchain. To mitigate risk, the proposed approach is to initially run the protocol in L1 in parallel with the protocol in L2. During a first stage, the L2 protocol would not distribute any Indexer rewards, and therefore not have any token issuance in L2. |

Cross-chain messaging however, can be connect users to other chains through a verifiable, trust-less network, supported by on-chain validators. This creates a decentralized network where users can interact with dApps without having to navigate cumbersome bridge transfers and the added steps that accompany the current cross-chain landscape. The end result, is a truly interoperable and decentralized Web3, where users and dApp developers alike can benefit from one-click in-dApp experiences. |

| Inverse Finance | | FiRM is an over collateralized money market protocol for borrowing the DOLA stablecoin at a fixed price, over an arbitrary period of time. This is accomplished with the Dola Borrowing Rightstoken (DBR) .One DBR token gives the right to borrow one DOLA for one year. As time progresses, DBR will be burnt from the borrower's wallet at a rate that depends on their debt. A borrower may repay their loan at any time, and sell their DBR at a potential profit, if interest rates have gone up. DBR are minted and offered to the market by Inverse Finance. DBR liquidity and market making is outside the scope of this contest. The DOLA stablecoin is Inverse Finance's own stablecoin, which has it's peg actively managed by a system of Fed contracts, that enact expansionary or contractionary monetary policy to keep the peg of the stable coin near 1$. The Fed attached to FiRM protocol markets lend DOLA to the markets by expanding supply, and contracts supply by recalling dola from the markets. DOLA is the only borrowable asset in the FiRM protocol. |

| zkSync Layer 1 Audit | | zkSync is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum based on zero-knowledge rollup technology. The protocol aims to provide low transaction fees and high throughput while maintaining full EVM compatibility.In zkSync users sign and send transactions to validators who process them, include them into blocks, and create a cryptographic commitment of the updated state. This commitment (root hash) is then transferred to a smart contract on layer 1 along with a cryptographic proof (SNARK) proving that this new state was correctly calculated based on applying transactions to a previous state. A compressed state update is also sent to layer 1, allowing anyone to reconstruct the state at any moment. The layer 1 contract validates both the state update and the cryptographic proof, assuring the validity of the transactions included in the block and the data availability. zkSync protocol implements the Diamond Proxy EIP-2535 as an upgrade mechanism. |

| UMA DVM 2.0 Audit | | UMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. UMA’s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets. UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. For information about Outcome, a DAO tooling platform built on UMA that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens and optimistic governance. The UMA Data Verification Mechanism (DVM) is the ultimate source of truth in the oracle and governance system of the UMA Protocol. UMA’s purpose is to serve as a trustworthy oracle for price requests of arbitrary assets. While the majority of price requests are handled by the Optimistic Oracle component of the UMA ecosystem, any dispute regarding the suggested price leads to the price request being escalated to the DVM. The DVM uses round-based voting in a commit-reveal scheme to resolve requested prices. A price will successfully resolve if the number of votes exceeds a predefined quorum and more than 50% of votes agree on the same price. Otherwise, a request is rolled to the next round. The DVM additionally uses its voting mechanism to make governance decisions, which take the form of a sequence of calls to given addresses with given calldata to be executed in order. Any change of the parameterization of the DVM (e.g. the quorum or reward emission) must go through the governance system by proposing the change to the ProposerV2 contract and in case of acceptance executing it on the GovernorV2 contract. |

| GammaSwap Labs - Core, Strategies and Periphery | | GammaSwap allows users to provide liquidity into an existing AMM(e.g. Uniswap, Sushiswap, Balancer). At the same time, it allows other users to short LP tokens (borrow the Uniswap LP Token and retrieve the reserve tokens it represents) from users that have provided liquidity to an existing AMM though GammaSwap and therefore profit from the change in price. What is normally impermanent loss to liquidity providers becomes impermanent gains to liquidity shorters. |
| Reserve | | The Reserve Protocol allows anyone to create stablecoins backed by baskets of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. Stable asset backed currencies launched on the Reserve protocol are called “RTokens”. Once an RToken configuration has been deployed, RTokens can be minted by depositing the entire basket of collateral backing tokens, and redeemed for the entire basket as well. Thus, an RToken will tend to trade at the market value of the entire basket that backs it, as any lower or higher price could be arbitraged. RTokens can be overcollateralized, which means that if any of their collateral tokens default, there's a pool of value available to make up for the loss. RToken overcollateralization is provided by Reserve Rights (RSR) holders, who may choose to stake their RSR on any RToken. Staked RSR can be seized in the case of a collateral default, in a process that is entirely mechanistic based on on-chain price-feeds, and does not depend on any governance votes or human choices. RTokens can generate revenue, and this revenue is the incentive for RSR holders to stake. Revenue can come from yield from lending collateral tokens on-chain or revenue shares with collateral token issuers. Governance can direct any portion of revenue to RSR stakers, to incentivize RSR holders to stake and provide overcollateralization. If an RToken generates no revenue, or if none of it is directed to RSR stakers, it probably won't have any RSR staked on it, and thus won't be protected by overcollateralization. |
| Notional Update | | Notional is a protocol on Ethereum that facilitates fixed-rate, fixed-term crypto asset lending and borrowing through a novel financial instrument called fcash. |
| Ondo Finance | | Ondo's CASH protocol allows for whitelisted (KYC'd) users to hold exposure to Real World Assets (RWAs) through yield-bearing ERC20 (""Cash"") tokens.

Liquidity providers (different from lenders) create markets for any pair of tokens, adding liquidity, and being the counterparty to all lenders and borrowers of the protocol. In return, they earn transaction fees from both sides of the market. Timeswap utilizes a unique constant sum options specification and a duration weighted constant product automated market maker (AMM) similar to Uniswap AMM. It is designed to not utilize oracles, is capital efficient, permissionless to deploy, game theoretically sound in any state of the market, and is easy to use.

| UMA Optimistic Asserter Audit | | UMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. UMA’s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets. UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. For information about Outcome, a DAO tooling platform built on UMA that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens and optimistic governance. UMA’s OptimisticAsserter contract uses the same incentive mechanism as the Optimistic Oracle to quickly resolve claims that could be resolved by the (slow) Data Verification Mechanism (DVM). The main difference is that rather than being responses to previous requests, claims are asserted directly. In both cases, the claim asserter posts an associated bond, and there is a short time window where someone else can dispute the claim and post their own bond. Disputes are adjudicated by the existing DVM and the loser’s bond is sacrificed and partially transferred to the winner. If the DVM is functioning correctly, its decision is predictable, so there is no reason to post invalid claims or make invalid disputes. If the claim is not disputed within the time window, it can be assumed to be valid without invoking the DVM. The OptimisticAsserter contract also allows the process for resolving claims to be customized by the claim asserter. Specifically, they can choose:<br>- The length of the dispute window<br>- The bond size and currency, provided it is supported by the DVM and covers the usage costs<br>- Whether to use a custom oracle (instead of the DVM)<br>- Whether to disregard the oracle result if the claim is disputed<br>- Whether to limit the possible disputers<br>- This allows the contract to be used in a much larger set of contexts. The last three properties are decided by assigning an Escalation Manager, which is a contract that can choose these policies on a per-assertion basis.<br>Even when the “disregard oracle” option is chosen, the dispute still needs to be resolved by the oracle in order to distribute the bond. The flag simply indicates that the asserter will not wait for the resolution and will likely create a new assertion instead. |

| Security Review – ink! & cargo-contract | | ink! is a domain-specific language (DSL) based on Rust for writing smart contracts to be executed on blockchains built with the Substrate framework. The main objective of designing this language was to make it as similar as possible to writing regular Rust code while still being safe and efficient. The choice of Rust as the base language for ink! provides multiple benefits such as type safety, memory safety, and small binary size, making it an ideal choice for developers. |
| zkSync – L1 Diff Audit (February 2023) | | zkSync Era is a permissionless general-purpose ZK rollup that operates similarly to L1 blockchains and sidechains. It enables deployment and interaction with Turing-complete smart contracts, which are executed on a specialized virtual machine called the zkEVM. It’s important to note that the bytecode for the zkEVM is different from the L1 EVM, but there are Solidity and Vyper compilers available for developing L2 smart contracts. A strength of zkSync Era is its protocol for passing messages between L1 and L2. This provides a standard way for users to interact with smart contracts across both layers. |
| zkSync Fee Model and Token Bridge Audit | | zkSync is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum based on zero-knowledge rollup technology. The protocol aims to provide low transaction fees and high throughput while maintaining a large degree of EVM compatibility. The scope of this audit included the bootloader which bundles transactions and executes them by delegating core functionality to system-contracts deployed on layer 2. The execution environment is the zkEVM, which uses distinct opcodes from the Ethereum-VM and different precompiles, but maintains a large degree of compatibility on the source code level. |
| LI.FI | | LI.FI is a cross-chain bridge aggregation protocol that supports any-2-any swaps by aggregating bridges and connecting them to DEX aggregators. |
| Morpho | | Morpho is a lending pool optimizer. It improves the capital efficiency of positions on existing lending pools by seamlessly matching users peer-to-peer. Morpho's rates stay between the supply rate and borrow rate of the pool, reducing the interests paid by the borrowers while increasing the interests earned by the suppliers. It means that you are getting boosted peer-to-peer rates or, in the worst case scenario, the APY of the pool. Morpho also preserves the same experience, liquidity and parameters(collateral factors, oracles, ...) as the underlying pool. |
